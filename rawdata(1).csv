[Sample: Boris Gardiner]
Every nigga is a star, ayy, every nigga is a star
Every nigga is a star, ayy, every nigga is a star
Every nigga is a star, ayy
Who will deny that you and I and every nigga is a star?

[Intro: Josef Leimberg]
Hit me!
When the four corners of this cocoon collide
You’ll slip through the cracks hopin' that you’ll survive
Gather your wit, take a deep look inside
Are you really who they idolize?
To pimp a butterfly

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
At first, I did love you
But now I just wanna fuck
Late nights thinkin' of you
Until I get my nut
Tossed and turned, lesson learned
You was my first girlfriend
Bridges burned, all across the board
Destroyed, but what for?


[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
When I get signed, homie, I'ma act a fool
Hit the dance floor, strobe lights in the room
Snatch your little secretary bitch for the homies
Blue-eyed devil with a fat-ass monkey
I'ma buy a brand new Caddy on vogues
Chunk the hood up, two times, deuce-four
Platinum on everythin', platinum on weddin' ring
Married to the game and a bad bitch chose
When I get signed, homie, I'ma buy a strap
Straight from the CIA, set it on my lap
Take a few M-16s to the hood
Pass 'em all out on the block, what's good?
I'ma put the Compton swap meet by the White House
Republican run up, get socked out
Hit the press with a Cuban link on my neck
Uneducated, but I got a million-dollar check like that

[Refrain: Thundercat & George Clinton]
We should never gave
We should never gave niggas money
Go back home, money, go back home
We should never gave
We should never gave niggas money
Go back home, money, go back home
(Everybody get out)


[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar, Thundercat & George Clinton]
At first, I did love you (Love you)
But now I just wanna fuck (I just wanna fuck)
Late nights thinkin' of you (Of you)
Until I get my nut ('Til I get my nut)
Tossed and turned, lesson learned
You was my first girlfriend
Bridges burned, all across the board (Across the board)
Destroyed, but what for?

[Break: Dr. Dre]
Yo, what's up? It's Dre
Remember the first time you came out to the house?
You said you wanted a spot like mine
But remember, anybody can get it
The hard part is keepin' it, motherfucker

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
What you want you? A house or a car?
Forty acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar?
Anythin', see, my name is Uncle Sam, I'm your dog
Motherfucker, you can live at the mall
I know your kind (That's why I'm kind)
Don't have receipts (Oh, man, that's fine)
Pay me later, wear those gators
Cliché? Then say, ""Fuck your haters""
I can see the baller in you, I can see the dollar in you
Little white lies, but it's no white-collar in you
But it's whatever though because I'm still followin' you
Because you make me live forever, baby
Count it all together, baby
Then hit the register and make me feel better, baby
Your horoscope is a gemini, two sides
So you better cop everything two times
Two coupes, two chains, two C-notes
Too much ain't enough, both we know
Christmas, tell 'em what's on your wish list
Get it all, you deserve it, Kendrick
And when you hit the White House, do you
But remember, you ain't pass economics in school
And everything you buy, taxes will deny
I'll Wesley Snipe your ass before thirty-five


[Bridge: George Clinton & Kendrick Lamar]
Yeah, lookin' down, it's quite a drop (It's quite a drop, drop, drop)
Lookin' good when you're on top (When you're on top, you got it)
You got a medal for us
Leavin' metaphors metaphysically in a state of euphoria
Look both ways before you cross my mind

[Refrain: Thundercat & George Clinton]
We should never gave
We should never gave niggas money
Go back home, money, go back home
We should never gave
We should never gave niggas money
Go back home, money, go back home

[Outro: Anna Wise & Whitney Alford]
Tax man comin', tax man comin'
Tax man comin', tax man comin'

To Pimp a Butterfly,,male,For Free? (Interlude),"Fuck you, motherfucker, you a ho-ass nigga
I don't know why you trying to go big, nigga, you ain't shit
Walking around like you God's gift to Earth, nigga, you ain't shit
You ain't even buy me no outfit for the Fourth
I need that Brazilian, wavy, twenty-eight inch, you playin'
I shouldn't be fuckin' with you anyway
I need a baller-ass, boss-ass nigga
You's a off-brand-ass nigga, everybody know it
Your homies know it, everybody fuckin' know
Fuck you, nigga, don't call me no more
You won't know, you gonna lose on a good bitch
My other nigga is on, you off
What the fuck is really going on?

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
This dick ain't free
You lookin' at me like it ain't a receipt
Like I never made ends meet
Eating your leftovers and raw meat
This dick ain't free
Livin' in captivity raised my cap salary
Celery, tellin' me green is all I need
Evidently, all I seen was Spam and raw sardines
This dick ain't free, I mean, baby
You really think we could make a baby named Mercedes
Without a Mercedes Benz and twenty-four-inch rims
Five percent tint, and air conditioning vents?
Hell fuckin' naw, this dick ain't free
I need forty acres and a mule
Not a forty ounce and a pitbull
Bullshit, matador, matador
Had the door knockin', let 'em in, who's that?
Genital's best friend, this dick ain't free
Pity the fool that made the pretty in you prosper
Titty juice and pussy lips kept me obnoxious
Kept me up watchin' pornos in poverty; apology? No
Watch you politic with people less fortunate, like myself
Every dog has its day, now doggy style shall help
This dick ain't free
Matter of fact, it need interest
Matter of fact, it's nine inches
Matter of fact, see our friendship based on business
Pension, more pension, you're pinchin' my percents
It's been relentless, fuck forgiveness, fuck your feelings
Fuck your sources, all distortion, if you fuck it's more abortion
More divorce courts and portion
My check with less endorsement left me dormant
Dusted, doomed, disgusted, forced with
Fuck you think is in more shit?
Porcelain pipes pressure, bust 'em twice
Choice is devastated, decapitated the horseman
Oh America, you bad bitch, I picked cotton and made you rich
Now my dick ain't free


[Outro: Darlene Tibbs]
I'ma get my Uncle Sam to fuck you up
You ain't no king"
To Pimp a Butterfly,,male,King Kunta,"I got a bone to pick
I don't want you monkey-mouth motherfuckers
Sittin' in my throne again
Ayy, ayy, nigga, what's happenin'?
K-Dot back in the hood, nigga!
I'm mad (Hey mad!), but I ain't stressin'
True friends, one question

[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
When you got the yams—(What's the yams?)

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
The yam is the power that be
You can smell it when I'm walkin' down the street
(Oh yes, we can, oh yes, we can)
I can dig rappin', but a rapper with a ghostwriter?
What the fuck happened? (Oh no!)
I swore I wouldn't tell, but most of y'all sharing bars
Like you got the bottom bunk in a two-man cell (A two-man cell)
Something's in the water (Something's in the water)
And if I gotta brown-nose for some gold
Then I'd rather be a bum than a motherfuckin' baller (Oh yeah!)



[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
King Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
When you got the yams—(What's the yams?)

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
The yam brought it out of Richard Pryor
Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires
Twenty-four-seven, three-sixty-five days times two
I was contemplatin' gettin' off stage
Just to go back to the hood, see my enemy, and say… (Oh yeah)

[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him


[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
You goat-mouth mammyfucker
I was gonna kill a couple rappers, but they did it to themselves
Everybody's suicidal, they ain't even need my help
This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail
If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin', ""Compton!""
I should probably run for mayor when I'm done, to be honest
And I put that on my momma and my baby boo too
Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin', woo-woo!
Aw, yeah, fuck the judge
I made it past twenty-five, and there I was
A little nappy-headed nigga with the world behind him
Life ain't shit but a fat vagina
Screamin', ""Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?""
Limo tinted with the gold plates
Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king (Oh yeah)

[Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'—*Gunshot*
By the time you hear the next pop
The funk shall be within you—*Gunshot*
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
King Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him


[Outro: Kendrick Lamar & Whitney Alford]
Funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk
We want the funk
We want the funk
Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it?
We want the funk
Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it?
We want the funk
Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it?
We want the funk
Do you want the funk?
We want the funk
Do you want the funk?
We want the funk
Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it?
We want the funk

[Poem: Kendrick Lamar]
I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence"
To Pimp a Butterfly,,male,"Institutionalized (Ft. Anna Wise, Bilal & Snoop Dogg)","What money got to do with it
When I don't know the full definition of a rap image?
I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it
Institutionalized, I keep runnin' back for a visit, hol' up
Get it back
I said I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it
Institutionalized, I could still kill me a nigga, so what?

[Interlude: Anna Wise & Bilal]
If I was the president
I'd pay my mama's rent
Free my homies and them
Bulletproof my Chevy doors
Lay in the White House and get high, Lord
Whoever thought?
Master, take the chains off me!

Zoom, zoom, zoom
Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom
Zoom, zoom, zoom
Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom
Zoom, zoom, zoom
Zoom, zoom, zoom, shit


[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Life, to me, like a box of chocolate
Quid pro quo, somethin' for somethin', that's the obvious
Oh shit, flow's so sick, don't you swallow it
Bitin' my style, you're salmonella poison positive
I can just alleviate the rap industry politics
Milk the game up, never lactose intolerant
The last remainder of real shit, you know the obvious
Me, scholarship? No, streets put me through colleges
Be all you can be, true, but the problem is
Dream only a dream if work don't follow it
Remind me of the homies that used to know me, now follow this
I'll tell you my hypothesis, I'm probably just way too loyal
K Dizzle will do it for you, my niggas think I'm a god
Truthfully all of 'em spoiled, usually, you're never charged
But somethin' came over you once I took you to them fuckin' BET Awards
You lookin' at artistses like they're harvestses
So many Rollies around you and you want all of 'em
Somebody told me you thinkin' 'bout snatchin' jewelry
I should've listened when my grandmama said to me:

[Chorus: Bilal]
""Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, boy
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Oh now, slow down""


[Bridge: Snoop Dogg]
And once upon a time, in a city so divine
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga
He was five-foot somethin', God bless the kid
Took his homies to the show and this is what they said:

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
""Fuck am I 'posed to do when I'm lookin' at walkin' licks?
The constant big money talk 'bout the mansion and foreign whips
The private jets and passport, presidential glass floor
Gold bottles, gold models, givin' up the ass for
Instagram flicks, suckin' dick, fuck is this?
One more sucker wavin' with a flashy wrist
My defense mechanism tell me to get him
Quickly because he got it
It's a recession, then why the fuck he at King of Diamonds?
No more livin' poor, meet my four-four
When I see 'em, put the per diem on the floor
Now Kendrick, know they're your co-workers
But it's gon' take a lot 'fore this pistol go cold turkey
Now I can watch his watch on the TV and be okay
But see I'm on the clock once that watch landin' in LA
Remember steal from the rich and givin' it back to the poor?
Well, that's me at these awards""
I guess my grandmama was warnin' a boy
She said


[Chorus: Bilal]
""Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, boy
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Oh now, slow down""

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
And once upon a time, in a city so divine
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga
He was five-foot something, dazed and confused
Talented but still under the neighborhood ruse
You can take your boy out the hood
But you can't take the hood out the homie
Took his show money, stashed it in the mozey wozey
Hollywood's nervous
Fuck you, goodnight, thank you much for your service"

[Poem: Kendrick Lamar]
I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence
Sometimes, I did the same

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
(Woman moaning)
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk-
Sex

[Verse 1: Anna Wise & Kendrick Lamar]
She just want to close her eyes and sway
With you, with you, with you (Ah, come on)
Exercise her right to work it out
It's true, it's true, it's true
Shout out to the birthday girls
Say hey (Hey), say hey (Hey), (Ah, girl)
Everyone deserves a night to play (Play)
She plays, only when you tell her no


[Chorus: Anna Wise, Thundercat & Bilal]
If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
If these walls could talk, they’d tell me to swim good
No boat, I float better than he would
No life jacket, I’m not the God of Nazareth
But your flood can be misunderstood
Walls telling me they full of pain, resentment
Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension
Me, I’m just a tenant
Landlord said these walls vacant more than a minute
These walls are vulnerable, exclamation
Interior pink, color coordinated
I interrogated every nook and cranny
I mean, it's still amazing, before they couldn’t stand me
These walls want to cry tears
These walls happier when I’m here
These walls never could hold up
Every time I come around, demolition might crush

[Chorus: Anna Wise, Thundercat & Bilal]
If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it


[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
If these walls could talk, they’d tell me to go deep
Yelling at me continuously, I can see
Your defense mechanism is my decision
Knock these walls down, that’s my religion
Walls feeling like they ready to close in
I suffocate, then catch my second wind
I resonate in these walls
I don’t know how long I can wait in these walls
I’ve been on the streets too long
Looking at you from the outside in
They sing the same old song
About how they walls always the cleanest
I beg to differ, I must’ve missed them
I’m not involved, I’d rather diss 'em
I’d rather call on you, put your wall up
'Cause when I come around, demolition gon’ crush

[Chorus: Anna Wise, Thundercat & Bilal]
If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it

[Instrumental Break]


[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
If your walls could talk, they’d tell you it’s too late
Your destiny accepted your fate
Burn accessories and stash them on the yard
Take the recipe, the Bible and God
Wall telling you that commissary is low
Race wars happening, no calling CO
No calling your mother to save you
Homies to say you're irrepetible, not acceptable
Your behavior is Sammy the Bull like
A killer that turned snitch
Walls is telling me you a bitch
You pray for appeals hoping the warden would afford them
That sentence so important
Walls telling you to listen to Sing About Me
Retaliation is strong, you even dream 'bout me
Killed my homeboy and God spared your life
Dumb criminal got indicted same night
So when you play this song, rewind the first verse
About me abusing my power so you can hurt
About me and her in the shower whenever she horny
About me and her in the after hours of the morning
About her baby daddy currently serving life
And how she think about you until we meet up at night
About the only girl that cared about you when you asked her
And how she fuckin' on a famous rapper
Walls can talk (Talk)

[Poem: Kendrick Lamar]
I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in a hotel room"
The Low End Theory,,female/male,Excursions,"Back in the days when I was a teenager
Before I had status and before I had a pager
You could find the Abstract listenin' to hip-hop
My pops used to say, it reminded him of Bebop
I said, ""Well, Daddy, don't you know that things go in cycles?
Way that Bobby Brown is just amping like Michael""
It's all expected, things are for the lookin'
If you got the money, Quest is for the bookin'
Come on everybody, let's get with the fly mode
Still got room on the truckload of black boom
Listen to the rhymes, then get a mental picture
Of this black man, and black woman fixture
Why do I say that? 'Cause I gotta speak the truth, man
Doin' what we feel for the music is the proof, and
Planted on the ground, the act is so together
Bona fide strong, you need leverage to sever
The unit, yes, the unit, yes, the unit called the jazz is
Delivering each year an LP filled with street goods
You can find it on your rack in your record store
If you get the record, say your thoughts are adored
And appreciated, 'cause we're ever so glad we made it
We work hard, so we gotta thank God
Dishin' out the plastic, do the dance till you're spastic
If you diss—it gets drastic
Listen to the rhyme, 'cause it's time to make gravy
If it moves your booty, then shake, shake it, baby
All the way to Africa, A.K.A. the Motherland
Stick out the left, then I'll ask for the other hand
That's the right hand, Black man
Only if you are noted as my man
If I get the credit, then I think I deserve it
If you fake moves, don't fix your mouth to word it
Get in the zone of positivity, not negativity
'Cause we gotta strive for longevity
If you botch up, what's in that [ass]
(What?) A pair of Nikes, size ten-and-a-half


[Chorus]
We gotta make moves (words)
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)
We gotta make moves (words)
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)

[Interlude: Sample]
""Time, time is a ship on a merciless sea
Drifting toward an abyss of nothingness
Until it can be recharted for its own destiny
Time is an inanimate object paying and paying and paying for no justification for belief
Time is dancing, boogalooing-away all memories of past—""

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
We gotta be a winner all the time
Can't fall prey to a hip-hop crime
With the dope raps and dope tracks we move blocks
From the fly girlies to the hardest of the rocks
Musically the Quest, is on the rise
We on these excursions so you must realize
That continually, I pop my Zulu [shit]
If you don't like it, get off the Zulu tip
So what can you do in the times which exist
You can't fake moves on your brother or your sis
But if your sis is a [bitch], brother is a jerk
Leave 'em both alone and continue with your work
Whatever it may be in today's society
Everything is fair, least that's how it seems to me
You must be honest and true to the next
Don't be phony and expect one not to flex
Especially if you rhyme, you have to live by the pen
Your man is your man, then treat him like your friend
All it is, is the code of the streets
So listen to the knowledge being dropped over beats
Beats that are hard, beats that are funky
They could get you hooked like a crackhead junkie
What you gotta do is know the Tribe is in the sphere
The Abstract Poet, prominent like Shakespeare
(Or Edgar Allan Poe, or Langston Hughes, or...)


[Chorus]
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)"
The Low End Theory,,female/male,Buggin' Out,"Yo, microphone check one, two, what is this?
The five foot assassin with the roughneck business
I float like gravity, never had a cavity
Got more rhymes than the Winans got family
No need to sweat Arsenio to gain some type of fame
No shame in my game cause I'll always be the same
Styles upon styles upon styles is what I have
You wanna diss the Phifer but you still don't know the half
I sport New Balance sneakers to avoid a narrow path
Mess around with this you catch a size eight up your ass
I never half step cause I'm not a half stepper
Drink a lot of soda so they call me Dr. Pepper
Refuse to compete with BS competition
Your name ain't Special Ed
So won't you seckle with the mission
I never walk the street thinking it's all about me
Even though deep in my heart, it really could be
I just try my best to like go all out
Some might even say yo shorty black you're buggin' out

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Zulu Nation, brothers last creation
Minds get flooded, ejaculation
Right on the two inch tape
The Abstract poet incognito, runs the cape
Not the best not the worst and occasionally I curse
To get my point across, so bust, the floss
As I go in between, the grit and the dirt
Listen to the mission listen Miss as I do work, umm
As I crack the, monotone
Children of the jazz so, get your own
Smokin R&B cause they try to do me
Or the best of the pack but they can't do rap
For it's Abstract, original
You can't get your own and that's, pitiful
I know I'd be the man if I cold yanked the plug
On R&B, but I can't and that's bugged



[Chorus]
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out

[Verse 3: Phife Dawg]
Yo when you bug out
You usually have a reason for the action
Sometimes you do it just for mere satisfaction
People be hounding, always surrounding
Pulsing, just like a migraine pounding
You don't really fret, you stay in your sense
Camouflage your feeling, of absolute tense
You soar off to another world, deep in your mind
But people seem to take that, as being unkind
""Oh yo he's acting stank,"" really on a regal?
A man of the fame not a man of the people
Believe that if you wanna but I tell you this much
Riding on the train with no dough, sucks
Once again a case of your feet in my Nike's
If a crowd is in my realm I'm saying -- mic please
Hip-hop is living, can't yank the plug
If you do the result, will end up kind of bugged


[Verse 4: Q-Tip]
Yo, I am not an invalid although
I used to smoke the weed out
Ali Shaheed Muhammad used to say I had to be out
Scheming on the cookies with the crazy booming back buns
Pushing on them real hard just so we can have the big fun
When I left for road, see, I was Boulevard status
Battling a MC was when Tip was at his maddest
It was one MC after one MC
What the world could they be wanting see from little old me
Do I have the formula to save the world?
Or was it just because I used to
Swipe the women and all the girls
I'm the type of brother with the crazy extended hand, kid
Dissed by all my brothers I was all up what my man did
Supposed to be my man
But now I wonder cause you're feeble
I go out with the strongies and I separate the evils
It's your brain against my mind, for those about to boot out
All you nasty critters even though you see I bug out

[Chorus]
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out"
The Low End Theory,,female/male,Rap Promoter,"[Intro: Q-Tip]
It's a fly love song

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
To the effect of nothing, effective fronting
Is what I don't allow so let me tell you something
I am a bonafide
Not too modest and not a lot of pride
Soon to have a ride and a home to reside
If my mama is sick I'm by her bedside
Used to watch the show on Channel 4 called Riptide
Wash my wears in Tide cause it's too damn cold out-tide
That's how the runnings go
If there ain't no dough then there ain't no show
So take your roly poly fat promoter (ass)
To the Chemical Bank, and get my cash
If you wanna see the people scream and laugh
You best Quest, you ask the Quest, you ask real fast
Cause I don't wanna see 'em, start bucking
Throwing chairs in the air while you be ducking
What what? Don't step to me with that
If you promoting a show make sure it ain't wack
Or else I'm leaving (""Let me tell you"")
I'm leaving (""Let me tell you"")
I'm leaving (""Let me tell you"")
Your wack show


[Interlude: Q-Tip & Phife Dawg]
Yo man what's up with that?
Yo don't sweat me
C'mon, five hundred, that was the deal
C'mon man, don't try to play me out
We don't need you, sorry!
And the Abstract rapper says

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
I want chicken and orange juice, that's what's on my rider
And my occasional potato by Ore-Ida
Don't forget my pastry make sure they're tasty
I'm not the type to be pushy or hasty
See I'm the type of bro that's reared in the ghetto
Took a few shorts before
Now the only ones I take are the ones that I wear
Ain't taking no shorts no more, now
Please act proper 'fore I call the CrimeStoppers
Don't dip on the dough, cause that's a no-no
Make sure you count your money real slow
Be alert, look alive, and act like you know
It's, the 90s, time to make moves
Not, the 80s, do away witcha womb
So what? You got a crew
I got one too, they're called the Brooklyn Zu
Don't break fool, let's be reserved and cool
We don't have to act like we in grade school
Just make sure that we're taken care of
And we'll do a fly show for ya bub, check it out

[Verse 1: Phife Dawg]
1988 senior year at Garvey High
Where all the guys were corny but the girls were mad fly
Lounging with the Tipster, cooling with Sha
Scoping out the honeys—they know who they are
I was the b-ball playing, fly rhyme saying
Fly girl getting but never was I sweating
'Cause when it came to honeys I would go on a stroll
Until I met my match—her name was Flo
Yeah, I messed around with the one called Flo
All the troopers 'round the way used to call her a ho
But deep down in my heart I knew that Flo was good to go
'Cause I thought it was me like Bell Biv Devoe
But little did I know that she was playing with my mind
The only thing I learned is good girls are hard to find
I feel like Heavy D, I need somebody for me
Not someone whose mind is blank and tryna juice me for my banks
Swinging with my main man Lucky behind my back
What type of crap is that—yo, how's about a smack?
Word life, I can't front, thought I was all that
But now it seems, I've met my match
I was a stone cold lover, you couldn't tell me jack
Settling down with one girl, wasn't trying to hear that
I had Tonya, Tamika, Sharon, Karen
Tina, Stacy, Julie, Tracy
Used to love 'em, leave 'em, skeeze 'em, tease 'em
Find 'em, lose 'em - also abuse 'em
My whole attitude was new day, next hon
And believe it or not, they all got done
Well here comes Flo with the crazy whip appeal
And I'm all true man like Alexander O'Neal
Is this really love, then again how would I know
After all this time trying to be a super ho
She finally played me, but yo I'd find another
'Cause I got the crazy game and yo, I'm smooth like butter

[Chorus: Q-Tip]
Ayo, it's like butter, it's like butter baby
It's like butter, it's like butter baby
It's like butter, it's like butter baby
It's like butter, it's like butter baby
It's like butter, it's like butter baby
It's like butter, it's like the butter baby
Not no Parkay, not no margarine
Strictly butter, strictly butter, baby

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
I remember when girls were goodie two shoes but now they turning freaks
All of a sudden (we love you Phife!) ease off ho, my name's Malik
Phife this, Phife that, where you going, where you at
These girls don't know me from jack, yet I feel like the Mack
You didn't want me then, so yo hon, don't want me now
Here, Here - take the towel, wipe off your brow
And take the contact out your eye, you're far from looking fly
You get an E for effort, and T for nice try
Now tell me what's the reason, for dying your hair
Slum village gold still dangling in your ear
You barely have a neck but still sporting a rope
Four-finger ring just so Phifer can scope
You looked in the mirror, didn't know what to do
Yesterday your eyes were brown but today they are blue
Your whole appearance is a lie and it could never be true
And if you really liked yourself then you would try and be you
If your hair and eyes were real, I wouldn't have dissed ya
But since it was bought, I had to dismiss ya
But if you can't achieve it, then why not try and weave it
If you can't extend it then you might as well suspend it
If you can't braid it, best thing to do is fade it
I asked who did your hair and you tell me, ""Diane made it""
If you were you and just you, talk to you, maybe
But I can't stand, no bionic lady
Trying hard to look fly, but yo, you're looking dumber
If I wanted someone like you I would've swung with Jaime Sommers
You wanna be treated right, see Father MC
Or check Ralph Tresvant, for sensitivity
'Cause I am not the one, I got more game than Parker Brothers
Phife Dawg is on the mic and I'm smooth like butter"
The Low End Theory,,female/male,Verses from the Abstract,"[Intro]
I had a dream about my man last night
And my man came by the studio
And his name is...

[Chorus: Q-Tip]
Busta Rhymes in effect
Shaheed is in effect
Phife Did-awg is in effect
Check it out and give me my 'spect

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
I'm moving, yes I'm grooving cause my mouth is on the motor
Use the Coast in the morning to avoid the funky odor
Can't help being funky, I'm the funky Abstract brother
Funky in a sense, but I play the undercover
Once had a fetish, fetish for some booty
Now I'm getting funky in my rap and that's my duty
Brothers tend to jock on the style in particular
If you got the ego like some brothers then I'll get with ya
But if I don't pursue, then I just don't give a (fuck)
My motto in the 90's is be happy making bucks
Girls love the jim, cos it causes crazy friction
When it goes up in and fluctuates the diction
I still understand the oomph cause that's what I met her for
I'm hooked on the swing, so just call me the music whore
Women love the voice, brothers dig the lyrics
Quest the people's choice, we driving for the spirit
If you can't hear it, then get the wax utensil
Write my rhymes straight up, don't give it no fancy stencil
The rhymes be getting sweet, we stay away from tart
A perfectionist at work, perking up the art
If you want to battle, I suggest you check your clock
Your demise is coming up and I want your man to watch
Be the prime example, or deeper still the sample
Insignificance, here I'll place you on the mantle
Born up in Harlem, reside down in Jamaica
The girl I used to rock, her moms was a Quaker
Now what does that make her? The evil money taker?
The crazy move faker, I use that to break her


[Chorus: Q-Tip & Vinia Mojica]
Phife is in the house (ooohh, you know you got going on)
Uncle Mike is in the house (this ain't a R&B song)
Bob Power is in the house (you got it going on)
Tim Latham is in the house (and on and on and on)
Wise Men is in the house
The Brand Nubes is in the house
The J Beez, they in the house
And De La, they in the house

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
I must regroup my thoughts and kick the next ones for my people
Please don't be deceived by the ugly slice of evil
The world is kinda cold and the rhythm is my blanket
Wrap yourself up in it, if you love it, then you'll thank it
Don't move to rebuttal, wave your hand for action
Some women in the 90's want more than satisfaction
They want keys and Gs, and all those illy things
If you want to, I'll show you, just what the Ab can bring
I keep a tight net with my brothers Ken and Kenny
If the question is of rhymes, then I'll tell ya, I got plenty
The thing that men and women need to do is stick together
Progressions can't be made if we're separate forever
I hooked this funky beat with the loop and the feature
This the funky singing by Miss Vinia Mojica
So listen because the Quest is led through the underground
My people have been oppressed too long, no more will we be down
People tend to riff cause they don't know the mental
People tend to bug cause the beats are hard but gentle
Africano lurks through the body of this youngun'
Play like Bobby Byrd on your back and you're coming to
The house of the jazz, of the funk, of the rhythm
All the goods are welcome, but if you're a villain
I'll just wait and debate, contemplate your arrival
If flexing is your motive, then you don't like survival
The Abstract is speaking, the hard beats is reaching
To Black and Puerto Ricans cause they're butt naked streaking
Through the ever murky streets of the urbanized areas
Blasting out the speakers is the hip hop hysteria

[Chorus: Q-Tip & Vinia Mojica]
Craig is in the house (ooohh, you know you got going on)
Pete Rock is in the house (this ain't a R&B song)
CL is in the house (you got it going on)
Ultramag is in the house (and on and on and on)
Nice and Smooth is in the house
Big Daddy Kane is in the house
Beatnuts is in the house
Special Ed is in the house

[Outro: Q-Tip]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
And this one goes out to my man
Thanks a lot Ron Carter on the bass
Yes my man Ron Carter is on the bass
And check it out, going into the '91 decade
Up in until the 2000 decade
You gotta say the Quest is on
And goddamn it, yes the Quest is on
And we out!"

Linden Boulevard represent, represent-sent
Tribe Called Quest represent, represent-sent
When the mic is in my hand, I'm never hesitant
My favorite jam back in the day was ""Eric B. for Presi—""

[Verse 1: Phife Dawg]
Rude boy composer, step to me you're over
Brothers wanna flex, you're not Mad Cobra
MC shorty black, there ain't no other
Trini-born lad like Nia Long's grandmother
Tip and Sha they all that, Phife Dawg ditto
Honey tell your man to chill, or else you'll be a widow
Did not you know that my styles are top-dollar?
The Five-Foot Assassin knocking fleas off his collar
Hip hop scholar since being knee high to a duck
The height of Muggsy Bogues, complexion of a hockey puck
You better ask somebody on how we flip the script
Come to a Tribe show and watch the three kids rip

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Queens is in the house represent, represent-sent
A Tribe Called Quest represent, represent-sent
No taming of the style 'cause it gets irreverent
A Tribe Called Quest represent, represent-sent
Huh-huh, here we go, you know that I'm the rebel
Throwing out the wicked like God did the Devil
Funky like your grandpa's drawers, don't test me
We in like that, you're dead like Presley
When we coming through, get tickets to see me
We work for the paper so there'll never be a freebie
Lyrics are abundant 'cause we got it by the mass
Egos are all idle 'cause the music is the task
Valenzuela on the pitch, curveball, catch it
I think I got it locked, just smooth while I latch it
Right, now I must move with the quickness
Here comes Shaheed so we must bear the witness


[Chorus]
Stir it up! Stir it up! Stir it up!
Stevie
Stir it up! Stir it up! Stir it up!

[Verse 3: Phife Dawg and Q-Tip]
New York City represent, represent
A Tribe Called Quest represent, represent-sent
The Dawg is scientific with the styles I invent
A Tribe Called Quest represent, represent-sent
MCs like to meddle, but here's my proposition
I let my lyrics flow, and juxt your whole position
I'm radical with this like the man this song is after (*laughing*)
Yo Tip settle down, what's the reason for the laughter?
I really can't say, I guess I laugh to keep from crying
So much going on, people killing, people dying
But I won't dwell on that, I think I'll elevate my mental
Thanks for these bars on the Biko instrumental
Yo I'll take it back, I'm the Indian giver
MCs take notes as I stand and deliver (word)
Percussion isn't less (uh), Ds wear the vest (what)
Why they dodging bullets (what?), you should be dodging Quest (uh, uh)
Don't get me wrong, violence is not our forte
I just like to rhyme, kick the lyric skills like Pelé
Tip educate 'em, my rhymes are strictly taboo (o-o-)
Fill 'em with some fantasies and I'll look out like Tattoo


[Verse 4: Q-Tip]
Ok, I am recognizing that the voice inside my head
Is urging me to be myself but never follow someone else
Because opinions are like voices, we all have a different kind
So just clean out all of your ears, these are my views and you will find
That we revolutionize over the kick and the snare
The ghetto vocalist is on a state-wide tear
Soon to be the continent and then the freaking globe
There's room for it all as we mingle at the mall
We welcome competition 'cause it doesn't make one lazy or worn
We gotta work hard, you know the damn card
Try to be the phattest is the level that we strive
Try to be the phattest also to stay alive"

We on a world tour with Muhammad, my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
Oaktown, LA, San Fran, St. John

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
People give your ears so I be sublime
It's enjoyable to know you and your concubines
Niggas, take off your coats, ladies act like gems
Sit down, Indian style, as we recite these hymns
See, lyrically I'm Mario Andretti on the MOMO
Ludicrously speedy, or infectious with the slow-mo
Heard me in the eighties, J.B.'s on ""The Promo""
In my never-ending quest to get the paper on the caper
But now, let me take it to the Queens side
I'm taking it to Brooklyn side
All the residential Questers who invade the air
Hold up a second son, 'cause we almost there
You can be a black man and lose all your soul
You can be white and groove but don't crap the roll
See my shit is universal if you got knowledge of dolo
Or delf or self, see there's no one else
Who can drop it on the angle, acute at that
So, do that, do that, do that, that, that (come on)
Do that, do that, do that, that, that (OK)
Do that, do that, do that, that, that
I'm bugging out but let me get back 'cause I'm wetting niggas
So run and tell the others 'cause we are the brothers
I learned how to build mics in my workshop class
So give me this award, and let's not make it the last

Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
Houston, Delaware, DC, Dallas

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
Back in '89 I simply slid into place
Buddy, buddy, buddy all up in your face
A lot of kids was busting rhymes but they had no taste
Some said Quest was wack, but now is that the case?
I have a quest to have a mic in my hand
Without that, it's like Kryptonite and Superman
So Shaheed come in with the sugar cuts
Phife Dawg's my name, but on stage, call me Dynomutt
When was the last time you heard the Phife sloppy
Lyrics anonymous, you'll never hear me copy
Top notch baby, never coming less
Sky's the limit, you gots to believe up in Quest
Sit back, relax, get up out the path
If not that, here's a dancefloor, come move that ass
Non-believers, you can check the stats
I roll with Shaheed and the brother Abstract
Niggas know the time when Quest is in the jam
I never let a statue tell me how nice I am
Coming with more hits than the Braves and the Yankees
Living mad phat like an oversized mampi
The wackest crews try to diss, it makes me laugh
When my track record's longer than a DC-20 aircraft
So, next time that you think you want somethin' here
Make something def or take that garbage to St. Elsewhere


[Chorus: Trugoy the Dove]
We on a world tour with Muhammad, my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand

We on a world tour with Muhammad, my man

We on a world tour with Muhammad, my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand

We on a world tour with Muhammad, my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand

Went to Carvel to get a milkshake
This honey ripped me off for all my loot cakes
The car oh yeah there's money in my jacket
Somebody broke into my ride and cold macked it
Yo Tip I tell you man the devil's tryin' it
But I'm goin' to stay strong 'cause I ain't buyin' it
Tonight I'm taking Sherry out, I don't have jack to wear
You know I gots to look dipped in the fresh new gear
Cool I found something so I ironed it
I then got caught up on the phone, oh shit, I'm frying it
Will someone tell me what did I do to deserve this?
I think I'll, pull out my suit for Sunday service
My little brother wants Barney, cool, I'm gettin' it
Took him down to Kay-Bee, they ain't sellin' it
Here we go with the crying, yo he's throwing fits
My blood pressure's blowing up, I can't take the shit
Finally got what he wanted, now he's good to go
Again the ride was smashed, where's my radio?
One time, the car was in the shop I had to borrow see...
They had no mercy on the car, Lyor will kill me
Where the hell can Nicki be? I'm gonna smack her up
I got the tickets for the Knicks and she cold stood me up
I need to hit a honey off, Jarobi pass the phone
Pulled out my book of hoes, oh yo, Sheila's home
Steady smiling like a mother yo I'm read' to bone
Went down on hon, she's in the red zone
Stressed out more than anyone could ever be
Forever tryin' to clear the samples for my new LP
Everybody knows I go to Georgia often
Got on the flight and I ended up in Boston
With all these trials and tribulations, yo, I've been affected
And to top it off, Starks got ejected

Problems, problems, problems
Woe is me I'm having problems, problems, problems

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
Just last week my girl was stressin' me
Now her best friend be undressing me
Well I was loving her by the moon ray
Now I'm tricking on her like Kinte' (c'mon)
Bought a bag of izm from the smoke shop
Walking towards the car, here come the damn cops
Now I'm station bound for the Thai sticks
I bought it for my man, I don't believe this shit
Coach sat me down from the ball team
'Cause I was breaking niggas on the inseams
Some niggas 'cross town was trying to stick me
All I had was shorts, a dollar-fifty
Picked up this girl in the hooptie
Just because I rhyme she tried to soup me
Pay for this, pay for that, loot for nails and hair
Who the hell you think I am, Mr. Belvedere?
Go and get a bloody job, then can we locute
Even if you give me boots, you'll never see my loot
She wasn't even all of that, just another hooker
So I turned that ass away, quick like Chuckii Booker
Sometimes you gotta put the hoes in their friggin' place
Just move from in front me with your batty face!

Socially I'm not inane, black and white got game

Falling out between the dome of the white man's mouth
It means that we will never grow, you know the word dummy
Upper niggas in the community think it's crummy
But I don't, neither does the youth 'cause we em-
Brace adversity it goes right with the race
And being that we use it as a term of endearment
Niggas start to bug, to the dome is where the fear went
Now the little shorties say it all of the time

Gotta get it together forever
Gotta get it together for brothers
Gotta get it together for sisters
For mothers and fathers and dead niggas
For non-conformists, one hitter quitters
For Tyson types and Che figures
Let’s get it together, come on let’s make it
Gotta make it to make it, to make it, to make it, to make it
To make something happen, to make something happen
To make something happen, let’s make something happen

Word to Phifer
Gonna bring it to the overlord, drinkin' Cisco
Chilling with the gold microphone cords
And we grip our balls every time we stuntin' on tour
'Cause we never bore, responding to the ready crowd's roar
And promoters try to hit us with the art of war
We about our business, we not quitters
Not bullshitters, we deliver—we go-get it
Don’t be bitter 'cause we not just niggas
Jarobi, my fiber wove into different cloth
Ain’t nothing forbidden, this nigga get his written off
Hardest spit in the city y’all niggas spitting kitten soft
Confused and amazed, shook up with your brain missing lost
They planning for our future, people
None of our people involved
Pouring Henny and Smirnoff to get it cracking off
Cracking off a Smirnoff to quickly turn to Molotov
Molotov the spaceship doors before that bitch is taking off
It always seems the poorest persons
Are people forsaken, dawg
No Washingtons, Jeffersons, Jacksons
On the captain's log
They’d rather lead us to the grayest water poison deadly smog
Mass un-blackening, it’s happening, you feel it y’all?
Rather see we in a three-by-three structure with many bars
Leave us where we are so they can play among the stars
They taking off to Mars, got the space vessels overflowing
What, you think they want us there? All us niggas not going
Reputation ain’t glowing, reparations ain’t flowing
If you find yourself stuck in a creek, you better start rowing
Used to see the TV screen as the place to land my dream in
And the car stereo where they would promote the show
Optimistic little brother with a hope you know


[Hook]
(Move on to the stars)
There ain’t a space program for niggas
Yeah, you stuck here, nigga

There ain’t a space program for niggas

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Sit and wonder sometimes, I read the paper every day
All these happenings is cycular, just happen different ways
And the president's refined, in her wing she's confined
With about thirty Percocets and five bottles of wine
Carolina nothing finer than a Black woman who climbs
To the top of the State building claiming that that flag is mine
Now, people on top of people, feels like we can’t breathe
Put so much in this muthafucka, feel like we shouldn't leave
Put it on TV, put it in movies, put it in our face
These notions and ideas and citizens live in space
I chuckle just like all of y'all, absurdity, after all
Takes money to get it running and money for trees to fall
Imagine for one second all the people are colored, please
Imagine for one second all the people in poverty
No matter the skin tone, culture or time zone
Think the ones who got it
Would even think to throw you a bone?
Moved you out your neighbourhood, did they find you a home?
Nah cypher, probably no place to
Imagine if this shit was really talkin’ about space, dude
Imagine if this shit was really talkin’ about space, dude
Imagine if this shit was really talkin’ about space, dude

The danger must be growing
For the rowers keep on rowing
And they’re certainly not showing
Any signs that they are slowing!
""We’re there!""
""Where?""

But a giant step for us

We don't believe you 'cause we the people
Are still here in the rear, ayo, we don't need you
You in the killing-off-good-young-nigga mood
When we get hungry we eat the same fucking food
The ramen noodle
Your simple voodoo is so maniacal, we're liable to pull a juju
The irony is that this bad bitch in my lap
She don't love me, she make money, she don't study that
She gon' give it to me, ain't gon' tell me run it back
She gon' take the brain to wetter plains, she spit on that
The doors have signs with, don't try to rhyme with
VH1 has a show that you can waste your time with
Guilty pleasures take the edge off reality
And for a salary I'd probably do that shit sporadically
The OG Gucci boots are smitten with iguanas
The IRS piranha see a nigga gettin' commas
Niggas in the hood living in a fishbowl
Gentrify here, now it's not a shit hole
Trendsetter, I know, my shit's cold
Ain't settling because I ain't so bold but ay

You bastards overlooking street art
Better yet, street smarts but you keep us off the charts
So motherfuck your numbers and your statisticians
Fuck y'all know about true competition?
That's like a AL pitcher on deck talking about he hittin'
The only one who's hitting are the ones that's currently spittin'
We got your missy smitten rubbing on her little kitten
Dreaming of a world that's equal for women with no division
Boy, I tell you that's vision
Like Tony Romo when he hitting Witten
The Tribe be the best in they division
Shaheed Muhammad cut it with precision
Who can come back years later, still hit the shot?
Still them tryna move we off the fucking block

Girl, this motherfucker's got rhythm

[Verse 1: Phife Dawg]
Say am I 'posed to be dead or doin' life in prison?
Just another dummy caught up in the system
Unruly hooligan who belongs in Spofford
Verse getting that degree at Stanford or Harvard
Threatened by my work ethic, the way I speak, yo
Should I be mentally weak, verse being Malik? Yo
Should I be trapped in the trap? Would you prefer that?
Fourth grade reading level but he knows how to rap
Are you amused by our struggles? The English that's broken?
The weed that I'm smokin'? The guns that I'm totin'?
The drugs that I'm sellin'? No need for improvement
Fuck you and who you think I should be, forward movement

[Verse 2: Jarobi]
Melanated shrouded in complexity
Brain charge shocking like 'lectricity
Mouth translate happens organically
The media relates it what it thinks it sees
Judging steps in shoes of a path they never walked
Shot down in a blaze of a phrases is how they talk
Dark skinned, walk with a bot portrayed villain
I'm chillin', felon down to the DNA crime willin'
Subliminate their youth, hyper-sexualize their women
They ain't got the strong enough hold, so they built the prisons
Pumping false religions to all of these niggas' systems
Every voice devoid of the truth
Come on, listen


[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
Man look at this, man look at this
Whatever will be will be
Like a billionaire investin' in a nigga's dreams
Certainly a head scratcher, like Pac and Big's killers' capture
Or a women with the wisdom who's leadin' the way
The rarity is in the rear, but never today
Man, picture a PD lettin' good records play
On the strength of what it is, not the finesse of your biz
And your lady calls you dirty, her dirts under rugs
You'll find out only if she tells you, take her kiss and hug, cuz
In the answer for cancer in a prodigious kid's mind
Yes, the government will fund, learning is free for everyone
And from that lie, young leaders will rise
In the eyes of despair and adversity
In some universe, this verse will be true

[Hook: Q-Tip]
Everybody runnin' when they see the storm's comin'
But whatever's gonna be will be
Everybody runnin' when they see the storm's comin'
But whatever's gonna be will be
Some will dash to the mountain, some will crawl
And the weakest amongst them, they will fall
But the strongest in faith, they will stand tall
Everybody runnin' when they see the storm's comin'
But whatever's gonna be will be

I just wanna feel as liberated as lions in Liberia
'Cause recently my heart turned cold as Siberia
'Cause everywhere I go, bein' cold is the criteria

I'm so confused! I don't know what to do
I think I'm going insane! My brain
Is on the brink of destruction, I’m looking for some [?]
Victims to stick 'em up and shake 'em down
If my friends could see me now—they’d wonder “Why? What? Who?""
—and ""How?” I’m living underneath, amongst the homeless;
The outcast bastards of the barren wasteland (Wasteland)
For days and days, I fast, fighting
Over scraps and rats, trapped in a society
Of the living dead (For ten—)

The tiger inside of me screams (Ahhhhh!)
My claws touchin' the mic for keeps, st-ress!
Keeping me up when the shitty city sleeps—a Southsider
Quick to peep undercovers in Chevrolet high-beams
Duo-teams love harassin' Po in the streets, I'm for forty
PJs, New York—no pork—uh-uh, freaks in New Orleans
See me get bagged by some ol' Uncle Tom-DT
In Louisiana streets, disrespecting my origin (Ohhhhahhh!)
Now, it’s my turn (I'm so confused!), I'm—coming

Pain, stress
My brain, can't even rest
It's hard to maintain the pressure on my chest
Excess frustration strikes!
Blood rushes my head when I come across roads
With dead mics and wack promoted shows it's hard
But with the presence of God
I'm true to the game
So I'm back, black, to take charge, and recapture
The time, wish it could never be wack -- I'm pure
I insert my lifeline into the track, the energy
In me is a poison with no unrevealed remedy
I'm spreading like leprosy throughout the record label
'Cause mines put me and Monch's career in jeopardy
Can you come see me in the ghetto where it's dark?
Bullets are real lost peeps lurks in the heart
Lord knows it hurts, we kick the Hertz to the curb
Execute first things first, and put blunted minds to work
My herd's tight and my fans supports
So I'm a-ight for the time being seeing peace
But taking no shorts (no shorts)

You will now consider me the apocalyptic one
After this rhyme, henceforth, there is none
No more will exist when I emerge
From the mist in whence I was born into, scorned
Most of you can't even comprehend what I am saying to you
Even in my human form the message I'm relaying
Why do you choose to mimic these wack MCs?
Why do you choose to listen to R&B?
Why must you believe that somethin' is phat
Just because it's played on the radio 20 times per day?
My perception of poetical injection is ejaculation
The immaculate conception
The hall walker, who stalks bodies in Central Park
Soon emergency services'll outline that body in chalk
Then I begin to walk away and spit
Then when I walk away I talk shit!
Huh, a driver sprayed my face with mace
She didn't know that I enjoyed the taste of radioactive waste
When I'm in the backseat of your mid-town taxi
Don't even ask me for the cash G
The four cabs before didn't pick me up
Now ask yourself who the fuck's gonna stick me up

The original book which contains the words of God
Six hours until dawn, my quest to capture the queen
Without being seen by the pawns

Pawn takes knight, knight takes queen
Queen takes the original King James version (check)

I used to watch my grandmother catch the Holy Ghost in church
For her soul she would search
Five years later now I'm off to work
In a department store, I'm foldin pants and shirts
At the end of the week, lord
Just enough loot to put some cheap sneakers on my feet
That's when I made a promise to my momma I said
""I betcha you see me at the Apollo one day and I'ma..
Be kickin that fat funk shit;
Black, mackadocious -- speakers in the back trunk shit""
Cause the boss is bossing me, that's costing me
To miss classes and I feel he's forcing me
To be a jackass in the future; then, who's gonna shoot ya?
At this point in my life is where I chose to write rhymes
Instead of doing crimes

Delete the pork, the cigarettes and forty-nine cent soda
We came a long way and I'm still runnin for my freedom
Still have one hundred miles to go, escape from the
Crack vials, so, you can feed that baby
I used to ride the elevator with the crazy lady
A year later I made demo cassettes with the Monch
My stick was on the fader, rhymes ran out quick so I
Encouraged Monch to start writing rhymes
And Mrs. J cooked dinner then we came into same hard times
Sour contract shouldn't have been on the plate
Two apes escaped, back to L.A. with our demo tape
The state of mind I was in since Paul C died is that
I gotta get mines, representin 40 projects so I'm
All-in, gotta make papes and all that
Close my own record deal cause I can't fall for that

Yo, first comes the tongue, and then comes the she
My homey's M-O-M, what? (M-I-E)
Yo, and to think to day one
In my eyes, I show fear
'Cause I stepped into his house
His Mom's grinnin' ear-to-ear
Gigglin' and winks for weeks
I would encounter from this female
She's sizin' me up for the kill
""Oh, what the hell,"" is what I said to myself
So that I wouldn't worry
I'm sittin' on the couch
And wish Greg would please hurry, what? (Up)
She offered me a cup of Ripple
Broke out the titty, squeezed her nipple
Said, ""Suck it if you like, but please don't bite it""
I had an urge to say fuck it, but I knew I had to fight it
Before I could say alakazam carpet mow
I took this old bitch in the doggie style
Greg walked in the room, that nigga cold had a fit
But all this numbskull could say was, ""Oh shit!""
[Chorus]
(What's the matter, mama?)
Oh shit, oh shit
(What's the matter, mama?)
Oh shit, oh shit
Oh shit, oh shit
Oh shit, oh sh—
(Son of a bitch)
(Son of a bitch, come on!)

[Verse 3: Fatlip]
One fine summertime, Sunday evening
Crenshaw Boulevard was in full swing
Perfect example of how looks can be deceiving
Rolled up to what I thought was a pretty young thing
Rollin' in a purple Samurai Suzuki
Dookie braids was the aid to her sex appeal
Dude, she was dope!
Man, real dope, on the real
Well anyway, I went, ""Toot toot""
She said, ""Hey, beep beep""
The next day, rolled down to the beach
Tuesday, me and my new Crenshaw cutie
Coolin' on the beach and now she's rubbin' on my booty
Suck-suck-suckin' on my neck like Dracula
But it wasn't all that spectacular (Why?)
'Cause every time I tried to touch upon her tay-titty
She would be like, ""Quit, hehe""
Bitch was frontin', but I didn't say nothin'
Then all of a sudden, after someone pushed the button
I got a funny feeling like something was real wrong
Looked at her shoes and her feets was real long
Then it hit me, oh please god, no
Don't let this ho turn out to be a John Doe
He pulled a fast one on me, yo
I guess that's one of those things that make you go
[Outro]
Shit, oh shit
Oh shit, oh shit
Oh shit, oh shit
Oh shit, oh shit
Oh shit, oh shit
Oh shit, oh shit
Oh shit, oh shit
Oh shit, oh shit...."

Uhh, do you take, Rhymealinda
Do you love me Tre?
Do you really love me?
To be your lawfully, wedded, wife?
Uhhh, uhhhhh, I do, I do, no I don't, I do

[Verse 1: Slimkid3]
Ah roomie zoom zim, I'm off to be wed
To Rhymealinda I remember umm, when we first met
In '82, back in school, used to play up all the fools
Sometimes you'd be my number five, sometimes you'd be my twenty-two
But umm, screw the dumbshit, 'cause little Rhymea's true
I can't wait to say ""I do"", and oh yeah honey there's no due
I got my chariot rollin', now I'm mic controlling
Got some spunk in my funk, I can't wait to put some soul in
We're rollin all strikes, we're havin' little tykes
One is little Mike, the other's Ike, I'm sure that you would like
To hold 'em, or maybe stroll 'em on their little bikes
When they're born, I've sworn, to bring 'em up right
You know, dope is how I breed em, beats is what I'll feed em
They'll be healthy like a health nut, I'm sure you shake your butt
Kick the verse preacher, and I won't disperse
Here's my life Rhymealinda for better or for worse

And you don’t stop, you don’t stop (What)
And you don’t stop, you don’t stop (What)

[Verse 2: Imani]
Well it's done, she tagged me, duck duck goose
I'm batter up, I can't sleep, the fly brother must produce
The power pack and I'm stacked like a forty-five mag
Straight up tennis shoes, in my pants there's a sag
Droppin' so much grammar gotta slam it down my mouth
Shup? I met a slut she, put me in the rut G
With the dip that was down with me from the whole front
Now front me never too cool how-ever
I gotta get the bread, gotta get the butter
Fix it up eat it down throw it in the gutter
(Gutter dreamed it) sour, (creamed it) gotta
Skinny-dipped into her ass as if it was a pool of water
Now the water's gettin hotter so I bought her a new ring
Maybe a love ballad is the song I sing
I gotta kiss her ass my tongue I hold before I curse
If you really want me BITCH, take me for better or for worse

[Chorus]
And you don’t STOP (what) and you don’t STOP
And you don’t STOP (what) and you don’t STOP
And you don’t STOP (what) and you don’t STOP

In tune, in tune, in tune, a button [""""Why are you calling my house, who is this?""]
A button, a button! Oh c'mon, honey [""What?""]
Would you come along with me down the lane [""Mike, is that you?""]
And I will pick your brain [""Oh my God. Who is this?""]
I won't be good like you think I will [""I'll fucking call the cops, don't call my house""]
I'll take a hammer and start to drill [""Oh my God, what is this?""]
Your skull, and then I'll really start pickin'
Your brains out [""What?""] I will be lickin' [""I'm gonna call the cops, okay?”] Mmm mmm mmm mmmm! *slurp* [""Quit fucking around""]
You taste so intelligent, ahhhhhh [""Hello, who is this?""]
Yes yes yes, you trusted me, now [""Help! Who is this? What are you doing? Why are you calling me?""]
I busted thee, top of your skull
You thought the day was going to be DULL??
A little very exciting [""Who are you?! Why are you calling my house?""]
I took your fingers then I started
BITING, and then I scraped the meat [""Stop calling here!""]
Off, the bone, of your leg [""Don't call here anymore""]
Ahhhhh, you tried to make me beg
But I had to insist, I had to insist, I... [""Oh my God...!""]

Well, I am the nigga in charge over here
Sack the quarterback to make a cheerleader cheer
I fix my funk like Thelonious Monk
Stayin' true to the game 'cause I ain't no punk
Never been a bitch so I don't act bitchy
Smooth on the vinyl like Lionel Richie
And for creeps that's asleep you better ring the alarm clock
Don't dig what I'm kicking? You can suck on a warm cock
Originate trends, my rhymes they get paid
So I'm making ends and beginnings, see, I'm never afraid
Of a pancake MC 'cause I flips when I sways it
Housin' motherfuckers like a real estate agent
Douse you with my lyrical liquid for this hip-hop era
So I suggest you fetch an umbrella for my reign of terror
'Cause you can get your posse and your army brigade
Because I am not afraid
Oh, 'cause I'm the type of nigga that you never forget

The fly-ass brother is Imani the Great
You fuck with me, I'll be the nigga who be slangin' them dogs on
Arms like sticks, hands like bricks, niggas be droppin' like logs
I used to be the nigga never down with doin' dirt
Now I got your girl callin' when she's down with doin' work
'Cause I'm the type of nigga that'll rock them drawers
Straight to a party, tuggin' on my balls
I used to be the nigga that'd keep you happy
Go ask your moms 'cause I might the nigga you callin' pappy

Well, I'm the nigga in charge-in
E.X. Large-in
Captain of a ship pretender no never no sergeant
See I'm the type of nigga to catch a bullet in my teeth
Then call you Saint Nick dick 'cause you'll get hung like a wreath
Snap chin check is what I do to put your head out
Trip bangin', known to sneak and takin' raps before they get out
I'm the type of nigga that'll serve you on a platter
Like the piece of glass, when I drop it you shatter
I'm the type of nigga that'll kick yo' ass

I'm the type of nigga that's built to last

Yep the type the nigga that'll say what's up
To a brother but a devil would just get fucked up
And it's like that, alright, black?

You better watch your hide
'Cause this sound ain't big enough for the two of us
It's a must that I bust actually
See, I'm the type of nigga that likes to breathe
And I'm the type of nigga that'll roll my sleeves
Ah, but if there’s a tussle I’m down to kick some butthole
Nigga crash nigga bash with very little muscle
Hustler in my heart so I'ma play the part
Of that type a nigga with the ice cold heart
Chilly Willy, don't be silly
I'll take ya Philly and I'll bone her
Make her disown ya
Change her name to Mona
Put her on my throne, oh yeah
See, I'm the type of the nigga so you better beware

The only difference between me and Alsy Palsy is I'm black, jack

Well, I shuts 'em down like P.E
That's what they try to be me
I own a size 10 in Nike and I kick you in your pee-pee, that's me
I am the one that kicked your daddy in your nuts
That's why your mental state was fucked before you hit your mama's guts
'Cause I'm the nigga and the boss
I flip it and I toss
This time there was a quarter only a dollar was what they cost
'Cause niggas on my Snoopy like the bird Woodstock
Getcha hands off my dick because I hold this cock
It's like I'm waitin' in the distance
Resisted from persistence
I'm Dirty Harry and I take your mama just for instance
'Cause I'm the type of nigga to make the fat lady sing
Hour after my flow, she wasn't shocked with my swing
But a little too much weight to be a new jack man
Got more rhythm in my toe than a whole blues band
'Cause when I rock the people roll when I recite from my scroll
Play the beat nigga forever mind body and soul

Um um, well, excuse me

Modal Soul,,male,Feather (Ft. Akin Yai & Cise Star),"[Verse 1: Cise Starr]
Light as a feather when I'm floating through
Reading through the daily news
Measuring the hurt within the golden rule
Centimetres of ether, I'm heating the speaker
Motivational teacher with words that burn people
Seeing the headlines lined with discord
It's either genocide or the planet in uproar
Never good. The rules of paradise are never nice
The best laid plans of Mice and Men are never right
I'm just a Vagabond with Flowers for Algernon
An Average Joe who knows what the fuck is going on
It's the hope of my thoughts that I travel upon
Fly like an arrow of God until I'm gone, so I'm

[Hook: Cise Starr]
Drifting away like a feather in air
Letting my words take me away from the hurt and despair
So I'm keeping it vertical forever elevator
Riding the escalator to reach something that is greater, so I'm
Drifting away like a feather in air
Letting my soul take me away from the hurt and despair
So I'm keeping it vertical forever elevator
Riding the escalator to reach something that is greater

[Verse 2: Akin]
Taking chances, word tap dancing with wolves
In an ice arena out there, deep in the woods of
Arizona, the sun be high, life's ironic
Ain't trying to be Dalí when I write surreal life
I paint it vivid, habitat crazy insane
Watch the propaganda six o'clock news and it’s saying
Cultures clash, for black folk and white trash
They revel in the cyberspace that might crash, dash
To millennium a million miles of running
At the speed of now back, don't return gunning
Rambo style, gung ho child gunning
Ammo blao two times loud stunning
Stunning, when I hit ya, lift you off the Earth like
Ayo, take you right back to birth and
Niggas wonder why, they might wonder why
This shit might happen but it does, they go


[Hook: Cise Starr]
Drifting away like a feather in air
Letting my words take me away from the hurt and despair
So I'm keeping it vertical forever elevator
Riding the escalator to reach something that is greater, so I'm
Drifting away like a feather in air
Letting my soul take me away from the hurt and despair
So I'm keeping it vertical forever elevator
Riding the escalator to reach something that is greater

[Verse 3: Cise Starr]
Treat you better than me, cause that's the heavenly key
To unlock the inner strength where my essence will be
It's the knowledge of self, understanding of the things around me
That becomes the wisdom that I need
Living this life to the best of my ability
Channeling energy to my thoughts into your symmetry
Remember me, because my prose remain gold
I got the gift of gab like them pimps in Kangol
It never ends, I keep it ruling like a cypher
The first caveman bringing fire
Innovating and higher; to blast mistakes I raise the stakes
It's double or nothing in this vaccuum space
I will, survive, divine the time to cry
Fuck a hold or hide, I'm alive with pride
And I drove the Chevy to the Levy
But the Levy was dry, singing ""This will be the day that I die"""
Modal Soul,,male,Ordinary Joe (Ft. Terry Callier),"[Verse 1: Terry Callier]
For my opening line
I might try to indicate my state of mind
Or turn you on
Or tell you that I’m laughin’
Just to keep from cryin’
Pretty music, when you hear it
Keep on tryin’ to get near it
A little rhythm for your spirit
But that’s what it’s for
C’mon in here’s the door

[Hook: Terry Callier]
I’ve seen a sparrow get high
Wasting time in the sky
He thinks it’s easy to fly
He’s just little bit freer than I

[Verse 2: Terry Callier]
Down here on the ground
When you find folks are givin’ you the runaround
Get your game up tight
And if you must just take your secrets underground
Politicians try to speech you
Mad color watchers try to teach you
Very few will really try to reach you
If you’re lost in the stack
That’s OK, come on black

[Hook: Terry Callier]
Now I'd be the last to deny
That I'm just an average guy
Each little bird in the sky
Is just a little bit freer than I

[Verse 3: Terry Callier]
Say, Ordinary Joe
Although they say you're just a lazy so-and-so
What they think is real
Is nothing but an animated puppet show
So don't let time and space confuse you
And don't let name and form abuse you
Well let Big Joe Williams blues you
In the light of the sun you can see how they run

I’ve seen a sparrow get high
Wasting time in the sky
He thinks it's easy to fly
He's just a little bit freer than I"

And now we have a wonderful surprise for you

[Chorus: Shing02]
It's funny how the music put times in perspective
Add a soundtrack to your life and perfect it
Whenever you are feeling blue keep walking and we can get far
Wherever you are
It's funny how the music put times in perspective
Add a soundtrack to your life and perfect it
Whenever you are feeling blue keep walking and we can get far
Wherever you are

[Verse 1: Shing02]
Like a movie that you can't predict
Like a book that you can't resist
I sing along a song that's oh so sensual
Bring along a sip to make it all so sexual
Verbally that is, making love to the music means vibing to the beat at night
With the whole city fast asleep, out cold
True words seem to rise to the lips, take hold
Of a poet in me, most powerfully
I feel free when the world doesn't owe it to me
It's so hard to find a gig that lives up to the billing
Trying to find a reason to work, god willing
I admit, my thinking is wishful
Like a star upon a child gazing up to the ceiling
How far do we have to stretch the truth
To fit the lifestyles borrowed and overdue?
We can take it all back to the register
And start all over from the canister
Let's break it all down into pieces of bright
Moments that pass by like a meteorite
Throw on your favorite reel that's good to go
On the analog player watch the people glow
Sit back to the breeze and let the memories flow
Comedy tragedy all the highs and lows


[Chorus: Shing02]
It's funny how the music put times in perspective
Add a soundtrack to your life and perfect it
Whenever you are feeling blue keep walking and we can get far
Wherever you are
It's funny how the music put times in perspective
Add a soundtrack to your life and perfect it
Whenever you are feeling blue keep walking and we can get far
Wherever you are

[Verse 2: Shing02]
Like your moves that I can't predict
Like your look that I can't resist
The ting-a-ling feeling was oh so mutual
The lingering appeal was so unusual
Herbally what is, medicine to a lone soul can become poison to some
With the whole body fast asleep, out cold
True vision seem to come to the eye, take hold
Of a prophet in me most visibly
I see clear when the world doesn't show it to me
It's so hard to make sense in a cycle of billing
Trying to find a reason to quit and make a killing
I admit, our dealing is painful
Like a star upon a child staring down from the ceiling
How far do we have to stretch the picture
Before pixelating the human texture?
We can take it all back to the register
And start all over from the canister
Let's save it all up for an ultimate prize
Homecoming gathering with a big surprise
Throw on your favorite record that's good to go
On the analog table and it's hooked to blow
Sit back with ease and hear the emcee flow
Hi hat kick drum all the highs and lows


[Chorus: Shing02]
It's funny how the music put times in perspective
Add a soundtrack to your life and perfect it
Whenever you are feeling blue keep walking and we can get far
Wherever you are
It's funny how the music put times in perspective
Add a soundtrack to your life and perfect it
Whenever you are feeling blue keep walking and we can get far
Wherever you are

[Verse 3: Shing02]
Um, third time's the charm, hopefully
When I chime on your door you'd still let me in
After all these years
The room that you caved in my heart is exactly the same as you left it
I realize that you have moved on
New styles and cliques like them silent flicks
I'm speechless in this golden occasion
The beautiful expression on the silver creation
This time I'd like to keep in touch
I'm a little bit wiser, a whole lot tougher
If I suffer through another nightmare tonight
We'll chalk it up as another chapter to write, all right?
Or wrong or somewhere down the middle of the road
I wanna see you again in a scene with the backdrop a perfect ten
And the music can take us back to the spot right then
From black and white to a sepia tone
Some dreams come with a tint or in monochrome
From black and white to my skin tone
Some dreams have a stint on the microphone


[Chorus: Shing02]
It's funny how the music put times in perspective
Add a soundtrack to your life and perfect it
Whenever you are feeling blue keep walking and we can get far
Wherever you are
It's funny how the music put times in perspective
Add a soundtrack to your life and perfect it
Whenever you are feeling blue keep walking and we can get far
Wherever you are

Okay we can take it all back to the register
And start all over from the canister
Let's break it all down into pieces of bright
Moments that pass by like a meteorite
Throw on your favorite jacket and you're good to roll
On the analog trail and you look the role
Just stroll through the trees and let your miseries go
Sunshine hurricane all the highs and lows

I took my first step with Panthers - born troopers
Got caps on both cans for the halls I spray
Slap hands with my mans by the walls we play
Now, waist chains and cami-flauge complete sag
Live pools, my squad rules
From solar to lunar, cheap to death
From no boot to Puma, sewed up like mesh
My cousin's hit the 'pike
I read it in the ??went it?? circle C-low
Now all the niggas hate is COs
As we move on the D-E-low
For our fam in jail, no stars just bars
No cars unless the BMT own 'em
Crook-town bounce streets delph to south ??bar on a??
I drape soul hearts, I make soul darts
Cover mad areas in my crepe soled Clarks
MC's lyin, is dyin' rap off
But here we all y'all
With pleasure, so it's


[Doodlebug and Ladybug]
One time for your mind
Twice times for Mumia's saint crew
Thrice times for the Brooklyn dimes
Seven times for pleasure
I stay on, he stay on she stay on
We stay on, we stay on
He stay on He is on
We be on cause
We stay on
With pleasure

[Doodlebug]
Here I go, the seven odd
Manchu squad
Black notes I quote, I dedicate to my young star
Via subway cars I span the metro
C-know sold stee-lo
Is livin' on the D-low
The galactic travler eternal explorer
Like the invincible Master Asia - a true warrior
Neither here nor there, the master of illusion
My sun moon sets catch reps when we cruisin'
The New York boroughs with classic boombastic
Studied all the styles and got nasty at it
Like a Thelonius Monk, I travel in peace
Left on, right on, black man from the east


[All three]
We don't quit 4X

[Butterfly]
Yeah like for nothin but beats and cheese
Subzero degrees can't freeze the cool breeze
Ease, easay straight Brooklyn do
Hit you off with some pellets did Brooklyn smooth, ah
It's that certain style, uh huh
Eshu-Elegba
Squeeze off style quarters 'til herbs get stressed
Playin' slick games and avoid all rest

[Ladybug]
I shows, five seconds after that
I flows left caught your rebel grows
Devils we grow
Jonesin' on the curb I glow
Still posin', a b-girl fresh as
This leftist gets with MC's one and all of 'em
Bust ninety bi-evels
And my whole crew walk with pleasure"
Blowout Comb,,male,Black Ego,"[Cop]
Alright, boy

[Butterfly]
Ah, man

[Cop]
Give you your rights

[Butterfly]
Here we go again

[Cop]
You have the right to remain silent

[Ladybug]
Hey Ish, what's goin on?

[Butterfly]
Chill, chill it's cool

[Cop]
Give up the right to remain silent, anything you say can and will be used against you

[Butterfly]
Whatever man, whatever
[Cop]
Do you understand each of these rights I've explained to you?

[Butterfly]
Oh, like I ever had rights, kid?

[Cop]
Do you wish to give up the right to remain silent?

[Butterfly]
Hell yeah

[Verse 1: Ladybug Mecca]
So now lets let into, in my pocket pack
Pummel and I epic, black ethic lack
I walk again, you were shade gray, come display
Mazes in black, fire in the west
Shit is shakin', it's fly
I'm in lookies when I'm pushing vinyl time
Up the Fort, where I'm caught
And my thought to shakin' up a few loose
Now I let my cause shoot, KRS One
Cause we fade in and out, are you swinging or coming?
I'm solid on this thought, this ain't living
It's heavy every setback, even when I was a shorty
Now we catch you in your four, thrice
Check me in another place, space, and joy
Nothing you could serve could ever
Ace me boy
Fat laces, I'm out, fat and no babies


""That's right baby""

[Chorus]
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right

[Verse 2: Doodlebug]
I got Harlem on my mind, Devil on my back
Brooklyn in my blood and Butter's on the track
I got insect thoughts, catch the cool ways
Clouds of purple haze keep me in a daze
The jazz, the jive, the poetry
The style, the lingo, the bags of equality
Many different things try to get to me
But in a world of hard rock, I keep my humility
The funkanaut from the kingdom of not
With galactic sure shot, they can't won't don't stop
Flock to the rhythm I bring
Sing songs call survival on the Mingus revival
Scored the bass hit, with my bugged out clique
It's Doodlebug, give me love for a visual script
Sip the groove juice, it's kind of rough
Sevens never bluff, I had enough, eleven


[Chorus]
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right

[Verse 3: Butterfly]
In the east I rose
Froze in the pose
Of a land diseased
Flows that cooler summer breeze
Nikki did Kevin's braids, we got four in the 'Lac
As we swoop at warp seven, holler don't crowd cats
Cause look, corpie is the color and Butter he do it low
All you hear is poppers and rubber I'm saying oh
Man, we keep it popping on hot days
Shit, I got the fish eggs dropping any block you dip
And I dazzle that mood with the cool out, fool
Easing semi-swerve to the curb like the do
I'm fro, blow, got that right
Groove with soul and I'm still spinnin'
Cross 110 and indicate them something else
Blackest space, deepest sea
(Scoff) My shit's, a natural high, the man can't put no thing on me
Now catch me when my mind stretch out, it's astro black
Time reaching into end, nappy afro blue
We Sw-ing, fightin' out the corners
Do my tha-a-ang like Huey with it, nigga

[Chorus]
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right"

DPS forever hit ya' with the live stuff
Suliman the Bronx Ripper on the live puff
V Love, that's my money like dominoes
Brooklyn do keep it rocking till the sun shows
I pop my junk my junk, I pop my junk my junk
I pop my junk my junk, Pop my junk my junk
I pop my junk my junk, like what you want you want
Pop my junk my junk, I pop my junk
The noise that we made is blue, in color sound
Toys who played my crew couldn't walk the new ground
Or chalk the new sound
A bop like Teddy Charles was burning
When I excurse on excursions
Arriving at the doors of mind shores of seas
Burnt you with degrees solarly
Plus my leather jacket go acid disappear in the wisp
In the mist, with a fist
Proletariat, Cad-i-lac steering it
Fro soul gold Panther crew grab our poppers
Now, I'm making bacon
Still saying wa ah salaam ah lakum
Fresh joints we make 'em like water
Butter rap treasures at my leisure whatever whatever
So I gave my mind a pound cause y'all we had it down
We symbolize the blessed and represent the rest
Grabs in my pockets I release my hot rockets
K.B. said ""What you give 'em?"" I was like ""Mad rhythm.""
That's my junk


[Ladybug Mecca]
Eric Dolphy always hits me with the live stuff
Bahamadia back the sounds with the love love
T.J. and Lisa real peoples 89 and still
In Fort Green on diamond back is where I'm at
Feelin' da funk da funk that's in the trunk the trunk
I feel the funk da funk, feelin' the funk da funk
I'm feelin' funk da funk I'm in the trunk da trunk
Feelin' da funk da funk, I am the funk
I raise everyday for the mass
Tote my fist right up right against the fascist
Descend to my borough fix my diction
It's way on time
Fossil watch fifth line still shining
I'm left this year I'm not a player
In my vein lives bell hooks Derrick Bell, Reggie Butler
See Marvin knew it, and Sly knew it
Cube know it and now we do it outta Brooklyn
Outta sight brown sandals handlin' M.C.s with angles
Commit to street corners where players be jayin
I'm saying a Digable swinger
Word to mouth brought the clout 'specially in the summer
We vanish like vapor
Burn paper
We deal real-real so chill
We linger in the funk


[Butterfly]
Yes Yes, bus stop what's (Watts) up
On the script side
Low down the whole mix and flips I 63
Jay B and M.C. baby blue great
Do it fluent keep it real and straight

We make it bump de bump, we make it bump se bump
We make it pump se pump, we make it bump

Save your corny missions for the tracks you lying on
We got ammunition for the streets we dying on

It's Saturday I'm looking at the streets as my Nikes

The flyer we get the higher we get

We showed and we prove

You want to see knowledge born, see C Knowledge Born
Before we fall victim we lick 'em
I ain't playin'

Meet me at the corner of Myrtle and Adelphi
I bless you with some joints, the mental hollow points
We do it in the park, we do it in the park

Keep the vocal strictly any joint, it's right

Ease back, the g's back with the OD
Sun is in, the clouds on loud

And I rocks no 'Lo unless its scrambler gotten
Me and my honey, we be like Bobby and Erica
Me and my monies, we'll hurt you boulevard empire

We live in Brooklyn

[Guru]
The fly clothes, cash flow, and crazy L's to spark

[Ladybug]
It's crowded plus they jerkin my space
Shouted cause they chase when I strut out
Sift through my block I'm c-cool
She's my mood to brace
Stole my mind back black
So what you play the boards
Skimmer we got butter so surfaces out
Clever, and I fix it for you, funk time is monk time
Slackers hit the bat, blackest fit my pack
And we for whatever
We get down in this pleasure heavy
And we are measured by the tens degrees of math
In a puzzle hand locked, clocked in struggle
Can't keep the three foot three above mec
In so depth I defect

[Ladybug & Doodlebug]
With my vanguard squad the gods in brooklyn

[Doodlebug]
And we troopin throught the Fulton forkways
The eastern parkways
I'm broader than broadway, nothing more than morays
I sways, why cause I'm a Brooklyn stroller
No ones cooler, pigs on my boulder
So I switch my pitch as I stretch down Atlantic
Strictly slickly with my fork mean tactic
In fact it's really on the daily
Kids with guns and herbs look for herbs
Now I think you feel me
I freaks it, cause yo like my pimp stroll is cool
When I creeps up the sweet and jeeps blast
Tools rule the area, yo these fool don't play
I got the comrades of love, so the g stays
Brooklyn side with the crooklyn slide

[Guru]
The place where I dwell is where the warriors dwell
Too many stories to tell
So on the block we don't talk
Stack of loot takin propers
Might get a serious offer from a corrupt ass copper
So um, stop the nonsense
Brooklyn is the illest, the realest
Observe these words as I reveal this
Man my peoples out here they get down for this
Each one's a one man gang with a crown for this
Mad burners to handle any business
And mad sneaky ways so ain't leavin any witness
Got way more drama the theatrical lessons
So my suggestion, you come correct no question
Cause if you comin with that funny hot dog style
You might get looted, executed black mob style
From east New York back to Fort Green
Brooklyns' classic mystical magic scene

[Butterfly]
We are plush like a million bucks
Down every ave for like a zillion blocks
Blowin out
With my nappy hoods down Fulton
Bless and guess style limpin past the Walt Whitman
Steelo's changed on the corners we hang
The crime stoppers get mad with poppers and tens
And my scrambles ample kid, no part timin, just rhymin
In other words, I play these curbs, with j u ice
When they say you nice, I say son a little somethin
Brooklyn's asphalt rolls like a syl keith rodeo
We bump the big sound, down and gritty
Record and mic checkin, no question, this section of
New York City
Where the crooks lounge out, Black Power is found
Butterfly ground the sky favorite package of pound
It's like th-that, the beats know we be strappin em out
Mad moneys wish they g like us, clout
When I'm in the boogie I'm imported, I study chairman Mao
Ain't nothin but Crooklyn in my plasma now
I got my g's behind the tongue of my gold high classics
I'm all city when I'm dipped, if you want us you can find us (aw shit)

Y'all the hippest people in the world"
Mecca and the Soul Brother,,female/male,Return of the Mecca,"[Intro]
To know the truth is to know the self
To know the self is to know the Mecca
Mecca's not a state of mind or a place
Mecca is a way of life
It is the answer to all confusion
The attribute
Adofo Abdullah Muhammad
Makes way for the return of the Mecca
Salaam

[Hook x8]
Return of the Mecca

[Verse 1: C.L. Smooth]
Be sure to explore the hardcore that came before Columbus
Discover no other serve the soul on a dish
Okay means official kid, not decrepit though
The lyrical dynamo set the flow when I do so
Entice the price with the mic device
Hit ya slice so precise that you never hurt twice
Fierce how I pierce when you near the frontier
A world premiere so put the armor on your gear
The overlord aboard with the two-edged sword
Adored and restored, now the young gun toward
Preserve the herb, never kick it to the curb
Vocalize a verb, and the return of the word
Mecca, the reincarnated selector
From the whole agenda, something to remember
A richer voice than Robin Leach
I'll reach with a speech, no bleach so you can't impeach
Monumentally smooth, I'll prove it sincerely
To barely when you're near me clearly never sound weary
Maintain the gravity, assault and battery
So sweet the repeat you're bound to catch a cavity
My ability to wreck a facility
C.L.'s potential, smooth and sequential
Deep in every measure, hit the lotto for the beggar
The midnight wrecker, return of the Mecca


[Hook]

[Verse 2: C.L. Smooth]
Overstand the Mecca in command
Part of the plan is the man who built the land he began
A scripture ripped out the piece of a scroll
Better the know yes, a foretold, the beautiful and bold
Start em in Harlem with the motto, the Apollo
Boogie to me, I'll swallow hollow when you follow
Stable like a turntable, lyrics I cradle
No fable, label or run my tongue around your navel
You're coming to me so therefore the program's Mecca
The silhouette, a weirder fella, darker than vanilla
Talking about the theoretical, isometrical
Alphabetical rebel, a dissect-the-devil
Unveil a tale in detail, the third rail
Read it in braille, a bigger male leave a trail
Now I sink into the link, that'll make you think
You's too large to shrink, I need a drink
And toast to emperor, Mecca said to invent
To know of a child, worth your while so surrender
And never to be lobotomized, the flexin' of the stanza
But you know the answer when I drop a proper grammar
Tabasco, the Late Show, flow to make a peso
I manage to do damage so honey, get Macco
Risen from the prison, the division, Black and Decker
Strictly for your pleasure, return of the Mecca


[Hook]

[Break]

[Verse 3: C.L. Smooth]
OD off the black Baryshnikov
Taking it up north, back and forth, never been soft
Bound to see me swollen like a Beethoven
Listen wide open, never toking, do or die's my slogan
Save the sarcasm, I'll hit you like a orgasm
Back off of that and maybe later let you pat em
Necessary for any adversary to worry
The legendary, primary, never secondary
Dip in Peru, overdue in Honolulu
Now if you knew the preview, could bubble like shampoo
Outclass the mass so we'll look in the hourglass
No time to waste for those in contrast
Like the New York Philharmonic, sent to blow melodic
With the logic I hear like a narcotic
Put your best to rest, so get your bulletproof vest
I got the wild, wild west to your chest
You know the cause of death, so forget the autopsy
Another got sloppy so I lit it in poppy
Smooth as Peabo, with dough like Lillo
For the grand finale I slip on like a Bally
C.L. and P.R., categorizing we are
The soul brother, Mecca lover, funky by far
The classic fantastic, rip it like elastic
Here to get drastic, return of the Mecca"
Mecca and the Soul Brother,,female/male,For Pete's Sake,"Here come's the rugged one, bust the way I flip it
I collect the loot and then I knock the boots
A smooth dark brother, prefer to be called the chocolate lover
'Cause I can do wonders undercover
I'm dip-dip-dope, I rhyme like riz-ope
I cleanse like soap, cause it's the great black hope
Stay away from the penile, I can rock the senile
Hons always wave cause slick like Nu-nile
Pete Rock on the boot knock, on the boot knock
Plus the way that I flow...blood clot

Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, yeah...
So funky, like a street junky
Like I said before, here we go, c'mon...

For Pete's sake I break and update, wait, I radiate
A dubplate to navigate the tune I make
I fit like a slipper, so catch the Big Dipper
Vital signs are quicker, not the flat line picture
Showtime original, official with the smooth criminal
I hit the cliches on the subliminal
With the soul technician to fill the prescription
In addition listen close to the mission
The P.E.T.E.R.O.C.K., resume
With the route to Brut by Faberge
No doubt, to shout about a 20-bar segment
Offspring of lyrics when the microphone's pregnant
Give it a rubdown, now here's the sermon
Everywhere you go you hear Mecca from the Vernon
Pound for pound, uptown, I get down
And bound to spin the record like a merry-go-round
The klepto flow that I touch is not a preemie
And who would ever see me when I dream of Jeanie
I don't think so, peace, I gotta go
And shake like an earthquake, cousin, for Pete's sake


To my man...

Here come's the rugged one, bust the way I flip it

I cleanse like soap, cause it's the great black hope
Stay away from the penile, I can rock the senile
Hons always wave cause I'm slick like Nu-nile
Pete Rock on the boot knock, on the boot knock
Bust the way that I flow...blood clot
Yo, my style's cock-diesel and I can do the hustle
Niggas know the time, I don't have to flex a muscle
I'm not the type to fake it, I wouldn't try to take it
Tie your girl to the back of my Jeep butt-naked
Slide her monkey ass down the hill
So if you don't want beef, money, chill for Pete's sake

To my man...

Music please...

(C.L.) The Mecca's sweet like nectar, maybe 'cause you need it
There's a ribbon in the sky, but I wonder if you see it
In the days of thunder, notice how I suplex in the proper context
Here steps the one, the answer to the riddle
Survey says the black pres can make you wiggle
The staff to the craft, the stroke of a painter
Perfect stranger, melody arranger
Loopholes are filled when I build with the skill
Liquid steels the mic on the Rock's chill
No financial aid wade when I'm paid
Deep as the Everglade, the escapade a renegade
Study in the archives, place your bet, sonny
Head crack back to back for the bail money
For you, a chapter, slayed by the author
Lickin' on your daughter, say, south of the border
Now, here we are with the funky repertoire
Draw warm like a spa, star, forget all the hoopla
C.L. Smooth and Pete Rock
Could break and penetrate, piece of cake, cousin, for Pete's sake

To my man Mike Daddy rock the house
And Joe Black rock the house
To my man J Steel rock the house
And everybody rock the house, signin' off!!!

Mecca and the Soul Brother,,female/male,Ghettos of the Mind,"Ghetto of the Mind...

I catch a body at a party, sort of herbal with the verbal
Look above and see the vultures fly around in a circle
Baggin' while you're lollygaggin', raggin', tow-taggin'
Assassin with the millimeter roars of a dragon
Here stood the black hood, thirsty for the end
And for the love of money, kind of funny, new friends
Public housing, a thousand in a tent
So I'm forced to sell hell just to pay the rent
Killin' my own people, I put 'em out of order
Just like the liquor store scene on every corner
I'm tryin' but the kids keep cryin', and the bullets keep flyin'
Look, a boy, he's on the curb just dyin'
Finally the cops come dumb to the slum
Pull out a gun and arrest the wrong one
Wax all the Puerto Ricans and blacks
So they can never relax
I dwell, might as well learn the facts
Pete Rock and C.L. can radio a shack up
Sparkin' off and have 'em all callin' for backup
""Watch another crime and you're gonna do time""
All this you'll find in the ghettos of the mind

Ain't that somethin'?

Listen to cats and rough rats war under the window
When the ghetto forts flurry, never was a Tom and Jerry
Livin' ain't cheap, my survival is deep
In this part of town where the city never sleep
A Barney Miller roller, you can bet the car's stolen
Or static with your BM, only when you see them
Speakin' on your baby's mom, a best for the drama
Always tryin' to make a movie, little stark-ravin' looney
Stressin' it, but you know the ghetto keep ya busy
A place that when I die it would never even miss me
Crack phials in the aisles as one pimp smiles
Dope piles workin' hookers by the miles
But still my pop's got three jobs to stable
A family household and food on the table
So as we pray for all our souls to keep
Somebody's on the project roof, ready to leap
I want to stop the pain or the bad situation
But backwards wisdom I can't afford to give 'em
Self savior is much braver with the conscious behavior
Designed in the ghettos of the mind

Ain't that somethin'? Yeah, c'mon
It's like that y'all

I could never look forward to an early retirement
But still I maintain in a hostile environment
Hustlin' the concrete jungle for loot
My parents hated blood money so they gave me the boot
Take a risk cause the peer pressure has the edge
It was a blessin' when I saw my life dangle on the ledge
The streets coulda swallowed me whole
But the pain was all gone when I got to see my healthy son born
And now I bring him home to the ghetto
Only to make a stronger fellow
Maybe do some good for the neighborhood
It's hard playing hero livin' less than a zero
Raging Bull like DeNiro, the modern day pharaoh
A concentration camp with the Section 8
Welfare checks given at a monthly rate
Apply for the get high, or just plain lazy
Many steady collect right around the fifth baby
The hawk is out but the niggas never pack it
A hundred dollar sneakers with the skimpy-ass jacket
When people are deaf, dumb, and blind they get left behind
Imagine in the ghettos of the mind"

Mecca and the Soul Brother,,female/male,Act Like You Know,"[Verse 1]
Here comes the hurricane, C.L. same name
Cut by the grain when I land upon the plain
Jah knew the Hebrew, a Papa Duke need you
But none of the fam who saw had a clue
Escalate the prime rate, words coagulate
Generate the mind's state, never can deflate
Nigga, you jigaboo, it doesn't have to be you
Funny like a cartoon, Pepe Le Pew
Pimp are the lyrical, g-string the individual
But the metaphysical isn't spriritual
Straight from the heart I frame the art
Tutor up my class, real fast, very smart
Dictate the technique, wait a minute, I speak
Loved by my son and a kiss on the cheek
Stutter-step the concept, blueprint, or pro
Steady as we go so act like you know

[Verse 2]
I stand by the rabbi, sail in Shanghai
Always had an alibi even if I lie
Crucial, never neutral, bare the fruitful
Past time, another rhyme, skedaddle, Yankee Doodle
Light skin in lovely gyp, just for the honey dip
Here to make a megahit fit
Don't install the pipe dream, renaissance regime
When you run ragged I pick up the steam
Chart on the record book, what Corey Love took the hook
Here's a new book to civilize a crook
Purest of the pedigree, feed 'em a line
C.L., no Jezebel, can never sleep well
Thick like a dred, at the Club Med
The Mecca Don said, a fish out of water is dead
Pete Rock, the soul brother, cruise on a flow
Swing low and yell ""Geronimo!"", act like you know
[Verse 3]
C.L. can play like Nike, come on just do it
Pacify the Gemini, soul into it
Pete to my beat is a rock like concrete
Hard for the street, the cipher never incomplete
A clean editorial, rather historical
Affordable, recordable, nifty like a portable
Mecca is the syndrome, when I come back home
Boogie on a baritone, listen on a phone
Libra, the achiever, toke a reefer
C.L. the girl pleaser, like Ebanezer
So here is the good sign, I incline
Titties with the bitties when I wine and dine
Warm like corduroy, comes the bad boy
But just like Anita, Pete or I bring ya joy
""Agoobilonians"" with your knowledge
And take as said so, flow and act like you know"

Thank you, thank you
And for my latest basket of cheers, here it goes, baby!

[Refrain]
Mess up my mind, mess up my mind
Mess up my mind wit the eye patch
Mess up my mind, mess up my mind
Mess up my mind wit the eye patch
Mess up my mind, mess up my mind
Mess up my mind wit the eye patch
(Everything I do gonna be funky)

[Verse 1: Pos + Dove]
Channeling in sync so my would bring (What!)
Wit dat, causin' all fat I'm responsible for ya diet (Keep it quiet!)
Yo I got beats, State this stitch on my national fabric
My daughter will speak the arabic that's how I live
Levitate to my nation when holding up your nickels
I pie like crumble so I Don like Rickles
Like green on the pickle
My papes are the up master of the cabbage patch
Ya eyes got the latch
So catch the cut, I hold the rut
For the people's reminder when in Maseo Path
I be the finder of the patch


[Verse 2: Dove]
Can the cat's tongue slip, ya do the 'da zip'
Take the horse into the jolly ranch
Keep the hush
The good, the bad, and Uncle Tom, beat it kid (Whoa!)
Do doo doo do do do do do
Show the sheep cause I found the food
When I string the man wit the eye patch, the eye patch
When I'm walkin' it and could ya make it go sha na na na
(Mmmmmmm)

[Verse 3: Pos]
It sniffs good
Punks show disguises when I'm standing in the wood
I be the in cause the brother holdin' Glocks is out
I be the in cause the pusher runnin' blocks is out
I be the in cause the kid smokin' weed
Shootin' seed which leads to a girl's stomach
Being 'bout a half a ton is out
Show the finger print and give me good grief for my lumber
Pants will sag cause my license as a plumber
Feel the Plug (yo, something's wrong here)
Now give a shout

[Outro: Dove + Pos + Mase]
Yo what's up, I'd like to give a holler to Big 4-7 off in the Oakenone!
And I bring an income in to my baby girl Twyla in White Plains and all my peoples out in Delaware
Yeah yeah yeah, and I like to give a shout out to all those r appers who dissed us on records, and I wanna let you know you're still wack. And oh yeah, I ain't mentioned no names cause you might f-

Biofeedback

[Verse 1: Pos + Des]
Ya go ""ichi, ni, san shi""
I can't cook, but being a cook I'm servin' much to eat
I got multiple stabs of jazzy
Sassafrassy as I caught the fame of soul
Years after mama had me tell ya gladly
I plugged for the Tunin'
Which cause eyes to zoom in
Which put your person into focus
No longer Kelvin Mercer but the Posdnuos
Plug One yo I found fun
In the scribblin' of speak
On a naked white sheet
Most recognized by my dark-brown self
Yo you found some wealth?
More in my mind than in my pocket
But I's got every Girbaud that ever sagged
I met some hoes, met some girls
Did a tour that took me all around the world
Did a tour that took me all around the world

[Verse 2: Dove]
I hit the shines but I'm shooin' it now
Remember when the floor might have had a spine
Well it's all bent over
The DayGlo nigga gets the red door mat
It's a roller coaster when your shit's burnt toast
Now Mr. Club Owner knows your jam
When your jam is the jam and there's a tab at the bar
My mindstate's great, no thanks I don't drink
I sip the bobo, then I kettle it quick
I felt the heave in the jeave, tap it in the basement
Diggin' my own understanding quick
Let me get the single out
Think Mr. Radio say the starlight
Is the same star bright
I'm thinkin' how a nine and a blunt is a switch
But turn out the lights and some will go bitch
It was one MC after one MC
Play the lamp post do the blow wit dynomite
Well it's okay and it's alright
Cause our birthday cake's external light
It'll all get graphic
People made of plastic
Look at the shine wit my 50 Watt eye
But when I got the eye patch I hit the latch
I fame it to a name from Denver up to Maine
And lovin' deluxe, she won't catch me in no tux
Nah, man I won't honor the style



Break: Dres +""Shorty"" + [Sample]
(Serious, serious, serious, serious)
Yo, shorty! Oh my goodness
How you doing, my name is Dres, listen-
Oh, isn't that Posdnuos? Oh, my God, yo
Honey you are-
Yo wassup,yo, man
Look, what's wrong with me? Honey, heck this out
Da da da dun dun
Da da da dun dun
Da dun dun (Dun dun dun dun)
Da da dun da da dun da da dun dun (Da da dun dun)

[Post-break: Pos]
Funny funny how time flies
When you have some

[Verse 3: Pos]
Light on the face cause the focus is the fickle
'Stead of fusin' I'm a use it to the utilize the trickle
Caught a rush, but I played hush
While Andres Titus is the grabbin'
As a fan will put the hearts to mush
Lush Dalea would hear the public beat
The same way for Titus when he Blacked the Sheep
But as the Knee went Deep, to deeper off the charts
The album faded to black, that's when the amnesia starts


Break: Dres +""Shorty"" + [Sample]
(Serious, serious, serious, serious)
Aren't you Dres from Black Sheep?
Oh my god, what are you doing here?
Who are you here with?
I'm with my man Pos, you know Pos
Oh yeah, Positive K yo, I like your music

(Stickabush, stickabush, stickabush, stickabush)

[Verse 4: Dove]
Hey boy, I watch that star man, shit's all in
Should I shot it or begin
I saw bootleggas no shinin'
I saw Big 4 go get shinin'
A typical flick was the moment
When the man said
""Ain't you?"" Yeah I is 'im
Hush your mouth fallin' in cog
Caught the light being True dog
A fist of funk and I pocket that screen
In the scene or in between
Gimme but a little bit of the starlight
I mail my ass to the darkness
I dig it, I dug it, I dig it, I dug it
I wiz it, I was it, I wiz it, I was it
Oh Lord let me switch it off
Because ya find some'll do it all
For the light

Why do we have to cross over?
Why are niggas always crossing over, huh?
I mean, what's the matter, huh?
They can accept our music as long as they can't see our faces?
One, two, one, two, You got it
Wootah!

Runnin' through the trenches (What?)

[Verse 1: Dove]
Just the other day I got a starter kit
(An M is a terrible thing to waste)
Caught the face from the backs of the border of the mindstate
I play control to a fraud
(Nah it ain't happenin')
Nada to make it even
Robbin' and theivin' is one who infiltrates with a Colgate frown
Y'all remember my nasal for I sniff frequencies
(Well, it started in the year of '78)
But it's '93 or should I say '94 for my style is much more
(I said, ""Come in"") Come in
(Come on) Come out into my reservoir
As I macks a men your bastard style has just been stuck
By a sticker with a 'frigerator lickin'
What if, how's about why would
Never thought that the napalm would bust your jeans



[Verse 2: Pos]
Mash it up
The one with the beard
Mega moustache the beat (hide it)
Deep under sheets, cover this hint
Hostin' all threats but watch out Mr. Jarbage
Jimmy and the jet, standin' on the pier
I'm known as the farmer
Cultivatin' mate without mendin'
Bendin', comprimising any of my styles to gain a smile
Listen while you hear it
There's no pink in my slip
I reckon that the rhythm and the blues in the rap got me red
While the boys from Tommy plant bridge crossin' to a larger community
Yet they're soon to see I have a brother named Luck
A nigga named Dres
A groupie named Cassandra caught bobbin' on the head
Of a Baby named Chris, I missed a kid who caught wreck when sayin'

[Verse 3: Pos]
Let no man put asunder
Severin' the groups I never blunder
Cashin' all the checks on the mic
I might cherry to the bush, brand Plug One-der
Funk to the fame against hoods
Bridges saggin' to woods down under
They can't be raised with the feminine praise
In conjunction with no chocolate in the mix
White boy Roy cannot feel it
But the first to try and steal it
Dilute it, pollute it, kill it
I see him infiltratin' to the masses
And when the leechin' I mo shoot 'em all in they asses

I shed light and not skin
I ain't from Europe
Afro connects at the root of the retina of the third
Mums the word when ya blind baby
Blind to the fact
Don't rest in Compton so I don't own a gat
But respect is clear crystal
Cause Millie got a pistol
And she's down with me
Wild of most wild
Born child to the old school legitimate (soul)
Talker of the many paragraphs ago
Walker of the plenty broken calves ago
Phantom of the phrase black in many ways
Cause I see her runnin' through the trenches
Comin' in to rent my style
I'm not the one to fuck with
I'm lockin' you out
I'm just not to fuck wit so check it

People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm,,female,Push It Along,"[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Q-Tip is my title, I don't think that it's vital
For me to be your idol, but dig this recital
If you can't envision a brother who ain't dissing
Slinging this and that, 'cause this and that was missing
Instead, it's been injected, the Tribe has been perfected
Oh yes, it's been selected, the art makes it protected
Afrocentric living, Africans be givin'
A lot to the cause, 'cause the cause has been risen
Some brothers, they be flamming, thinking we ain't slammin'
Coming off like the days when we used to wear the tans and
A blue-collar talker, hemisphere stalker
A glass of OJ and a ten mile walk-a
If you're in a Jeep and you dig what you're hearing
Can I get a beep and a side order of cheering?
I am what I am, that's a tribal man
We all know the colors, we all must stand
As we start our travels, things they will unravel
""Que sera sera"", for this unit is like gravel
Won't be gone for long, listen to the song
If you can't pull it, all ya gotta do is—

[Hook]
Push it along, push it along
Push it along, yeah, push it along
Push it along, push it along
Push it along, yeah, push it along
Push it along, push it along
Push it along, yeah, push it along
Push it along, push it along
Push it along, yeah, push it along


[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
Put one up for the Phifer, it's time to decipher
The ills of the world make the situation lighter
The clock is always ticking, the systems should be kickin'
Like Tip said in ""Ham and Eggs"", I eat chicken, chicken, chicken
Should I release the lever, the lever of the clever
Embellish on the funk as we start to endeavor?
The roots of the rap filling up the gap
With the smash of a hand and a little toe tap

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
The boom, the bip—the boom-bip
Indicates to the brothers that we be on the flip tip
Phonies start to crumble, funky rhythm rumbles
Through the dance-hall, but my anthem is humble
It's the nitty-gritty, my time is itty-bitty
So I kick the slash for the gipper and the witty
This ain't trial and error, more like tribin' era
Constantly rude as some sort of tribal terror
The street can't depart from the bloody heart
Repair the wear and tear, don't stop 'fore it starts
Won't be gone for long, listen to the song
If you can't pull it, all ya gotta do is—

[Hook]
Push it along, push it along
Push it along, yeah, push it along
Push it along, push it along
Push it along, yeah, push it along
Push it along, push it along
Push it along, yeah, push it along
Push it along, push it along
Push it along, yeah, push it along


[Verse 4: Q-Tip]
Marching off the project, we hope that you will subject
It's good to be an object and never, ever reject
The tribe who meanders with drunken propaganda
Keep it in boom and never will we slander
Redeems should be handed, don't let me demand it
Money gives a nudge to the poet star bandit
Control it, then recluse it, follow, you won't lose it
Mysterious is the tribe for we choose it
Although she's flipping crazy, give my love to Gracie
God, could you help 'cause this Quest is crazy spacey?
The pigs are wearing blue, and in a year or two
We'll be going up the creek in a great big canoe
What we gonna do, save me and my brothers?
Hop inside the bed and pull over the covers
Never will we do that and we ain't trying to rule that
We just want a slab of the ham, don't you know, black?
This society of fake reality
Are nothing but a peg of informality
While I sing my song, sing it all day long
If you can't pull it, all ya gotta do is—

[Hook]
Push it along, push it along
Push it along, yeah, push it along
Push it along, push it along
Push it along, yeah, push it along
Push it along, push it along
Push it along, yeah, push it along
Push it along, push it along
Push it along, yeah, push it along"

Brother, brother, brother, Lucien, you're like no other
Listen very close 'cause I don't like to boast
Instead, I'll tell the tale of a French who prevailed
Through the Mr. Crazy Rabbits who were always on his tail
We ain't on sale, your rumor starts to wail
Get caught with stolen goods and you will go to jail
If you go to jail, then who will pay the bail?
Deport you back to France on a ship with a sail
Escargot, Lucien, you eat snails
(Hey yo Tip, what's wrong with snails?)
From the Zulu nation, from a town called Paris
Came to America to find liberty
Instead of finding pleasure, all you found was misery
But listen, Lucien, you have a friend in me
Oh, luck-luck will drive your butt batty
Next time you get some wheels, make it a Caddy
In terms of doing good, I know you wish you really could
But listen, brother man, I really think you can
Succeed with the breed of the brothers on your back
It's the creme de la creme, and you can vouch for that
It'll take a minute, rice, so take my advice
Trust in us, and thus you trust in your life

I couldn't do it by myself
Yo, it's [?] it to my [?]

Are you ready, Lu? This one is for you
Comin' from a true-blue, fits like a shoe
""¿Cómo está usted?"" or ""Comment allez-vous""
Lucien, I'll leave it up to you
Voulez-vous? (vous)
Rendez-vous (vous)
Coucou (cou)
Les poupous (pou)
Watch that lass, gonna backlash fast
Can you get a grip on the crackhead dip?
Sold you a paper bag, guess he saw you comin'
VCR from a neck-bone bummin'
$10 brother, he was hummin' and strummin'
Only had 20, he was livin' like ya slummin'
Gave him the money, well, I thought that was somethin'
Lookin' like a kid who was lost in crumbin'
Don't worry about a thing, I won't get specific
This is a song that is long and prolific
Think of the stuff that I said if you can
Figure it out, compute, understand
No problemo, I'll help you with your demo
If you go to the store for me
Lucien, I'm just kiddin'
You should know!

[Break: Lucien]
- Hey, yo, wassup' man? What's your name?
- What kind of accent is that?

I'm sexy, and I'm french, everybody love my accent, I'm the best, yes, yeah! Je t'aime! I love you! I love you oui, je t'aime! I'll teach you french, I'll make your french good!

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
You gotta get a grip on the missions you'll be takin'
Not so much the mission, but you got crazy ignition
Sure, the sugar-babies wanna give you a chance
With the French ""savoir faire"" and the sexy glance
But is she really fly, or is she a guy?
I won't ask why, 'cause I know that you try
You try too hard, is that the answer to the riddle?
Instead of doin' so much, why don't you do just a little?
Boy, what a cad, I guess we shouldn't treat him bad
In fact, it would be nice if we understood him, right?
A case of positionin' the feet in the shoes
Sympathetic reason in the case of the blues
Lucien is blue, even though he's really brown
I had to make the sound, his life is too profound
On the up-and-up, he's somethin' like a little pup
Young and naive, it's hard to believe
As long as you're strong, you can quest with the Questers
Jolly like a jumping bean or a jester
Lucien, Lucien, Lucien, Lucien
You should know!

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Ten after one I think I'll hop the horse
Downtown '83 of course
Just came from fishing, couldn't get a catch
Downtown they'll probably have a batch
A whiting sandwich and a Guinness Stout
But with the beer though I had a bout
So I exchanged it for some apple juice
I had the blues but I shook them loose
A jeep is blasting from the urban streets
Loops of funk over hardcore beats
The moon dabbles in the morning sky
As the minutes just creep on by
I get a thought and here comes my Tribe
Ritual shakes and in good vibes
Like always the Quest begins
In the mist though but the rhythms moving
We find a spot and we sit and chat
Speaking on the status quo of rap
A derelict makes a real long speech
We pay attention to the words he read
When he was done we rattled on
There was no rush because it wasn't dawn
We pointed things out about these times
The worlds famines and the crazy crimes
Inflation of the nation, it bothers me
I better go gold, to pay the taxes
Gotta be swift 'n society
The man whose made is the man who maxes
The grounds for living are being discussed
As we go, it gets close to dusk
Gather thoughts and savor breath
'Cause there's only a few hours left


[Hook]
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Me oh my, hey-hey, hey-hey
The human hours are here to stay
This is how it seems as Phife's my witness
Bug out all night, ask Phife, he's with this
Girls be screaming on this conversation
I have my two cents for a revelation
And my watch continuously tick-tocks
Shaheed will bring up the beats that rocks
I hear the frogs and the smashing of bottles
A car revs up and I hear it throttle
It probably moves with the morning wind
Oh my God, here's Phife again
Hear him talking about last night's game
Trying to remember someone's name
So hear the frogs dancing in the streets
Once again Ali will bring up the beat
Like this

[Interlude]
*sounds of frogs


[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
The beat is over and so is the night
The sun is risen and the shine is bright
We all say peace and go our separate ways
Youth is fading as we gain our days
Expedition for the song is simp'
The hours creep, excuse me, I mean limp
As we go you hear a gasp of laugh
As we start up our rhythmic path
Like this

[Hook]
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool"
People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm,,female,Footprints,"[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
As we start trudging
Me and my brothers we be looking and be bugging
Vehicles of life they be rolling and be nudging
Searching for the virgins of life
That be shoving out the door that's crack
The valleys of time, are always on my feet
As least the beat will combine
The calluses and corns with the funky bassline
You don't need Underdog for a nickel shoeshine or the shoes that's phat
But can I get a level on the bass and on the treble?
Footing up and down like a UNLV Rebel
The answer be amongst us 'cause we really dig acoustics
Can't be too much flacking, not too much packing
You must container that at least to dip your hand in rap
Your feet will be infectious so at least realize the fact
The rhythms are inserted and the nurse can be converted
This ain't rock 'n' roll 'cause the rap is in control
If you're a megastar, words will buy you a car
I'd rather go barefooting, for prints I will be putting
All over the earth if we can get there first
Now that we are in it, footprints are being printed
So if you recognize 'em, you can try to size 'em
They'll probably be the ones with the size nine flying
All over the field, you won't have to yield
If you want protection you can hide behind the shield

[Interlude: Jesse Jackson]
And the musician often tries to capture the new thing so that we might have melody and have rhythm as we do our thing
It's rough and tough in this ghetto, a lot of funny stuff going down but you got to walk tall. Walk tall!

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
You can game on the gallons if you really need to rock
But we walk while we talk as we stomping through the block
Hand in hand 'cross the land as Muhammad cross the fade
It's a Tribe who meanders, precious like a jade
It's a art, Theo arch rhymes the ground placed upon
The mind will unwind, it will soft to beyond
Catch the track, track by track, get a map to track a trail
You will find yourself behind for a map does not prevail
See the levels peaking as the rhythms keep-a screeching
A Quest, oh yes a Quest, inside the jam I will keep preaching
The point, oh yes the point, because it's close but yet so far
The liveliness is mean as we scoot across the star
We are bulging, I'm indulging in a rat-a-tat-tat
Explanation for the line is that the rhythm is phat
Keep it wild, wide and deep, you could dig it in a Jeep
But dig it in the ground because the footprint now

[Interlude: Jesse Jackson]
Walk tall!

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
If there's a storm that's brewing, it won't keep us from doing
Our thing as we start swinging, travelling is bringing
Joy inside the domes as we hit the road to Rome
A chair is not a chair, a house is not a home
Because my skin is brown, yo I'm gonna do the town
Rub it in the face and rub my feet all through the place
When you get your finger on the music it'll linger
Sing a song o' sixpence, sing it like a singer
A Nubian, a Nubian, a proud one at that
Remember me, the brother who said ""Black is black""
You can come while we Quest, I don't play, I don't jest
Get emotions off your chest, we are Black, we been blessed
Making moves, making motions, flowing like an ocean
The walking will continue, we know that we will bring you
The times that you have waited, more anticipated
Be gone but not for long because the feet will stay strong"

Toqué ese guitarra!

[Chorus: Q-Tip]
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I got to get it, I got, got to get it
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I got to get it, I got, got to get it

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
My mother went away for a month-long trip
Her and some friends on an ocean liner ship
She made a big mistake by leaving me home
I had to roam so I picked up the phone
Dialed Ali up to see what was going down
Told him I pick him up so we could drive around
Took the Dodge Dart, a '74
My mother left a yard but I needed one more
Shaheed had me covered with a hundred greenbacks
So we left Brooklyn and we made big tracks
Drove down the Belt, got on the Conduit
Came to a toll, and paid and went through it
Had no destination, we was on a quest
Ali laid in the back so he can get rest
Drove down the road for two-days-and-a-half
The sun had just risen on a dusty path
Just then a figure had caught my eye
A man with a sombrero who was 4 feet high
I pulled over to ask where we was at
His index finger he tipped up his hat
El segundo, he said, my name is Pedro
If you need directions, I'll tell you pronto
Need a civilization, some sort of reservation
He said a mile south there's a fast food station
Thanks, señor, as I started the motor
Ali said ""Damn, Tip, what did you drive so far for?""



[Skit]
Well, describe to me what the wallet looks like

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Anyway a gas station we passed
We got gas and went on to get grub
It was a nice little pub in the middle of nowhere
Anywhere would have been better
I ordered enchiladas and I ate 'em
Ali had the fruit punch
When we finished we thought for ways to get back
I had a hunch
Ali said: pay for lunch, so I did it
Pulled out the wallet and I saw this wicked beautiful lady
She was a waitress there
Put the wallet down and stared and stared
To put me back into reality, here's Shaheed
""Yo Tip man, you got what you need?""
I checked for keys and started to step
And what do you know, my wallet I forget

[Skit]
It was a brown wallet, it had props numbers
It had my jimmy hats, I gotta get it man

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
Lord, have mercy
The heat got hotter, Ali starts to curse me
I feel bad but he makes me feel badder
Chit-chit-chatter, car starts to scatter
Breaking on out, we was northeast bound
Jetting on down at the speed of sound
Three days coming and three more going
We get back and there was no slack
490 Madison, we're here, Sha
He said, ""all right, Tip, see you tomorrow
Thinking about the past week, the last week
Hands go in my pocket, I can't speak
Hopped in the car and torped' to the shack
Of Shaheed, we gotta go back
When he said ""Why?,"" I said ""We gotta go
'Cause I left my wallet in El Segundo""


[Chorus: Q-Tip]
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I got to get it, I got, got to get it
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I left my wallet in El Segundo
Come on, let's go

Come on, let's go

Below the Heavens,,male,My World Is..,"[Verse 1: Blu]
Yeah, you know my name rings a bell
Or should I say rocks 'em. I'm shell toe rockin
females I don't got 'em but get em with no problem
And I don't pack stadiums yet, I still rock em
And they still spell my name fucked up on their flyers
It's B-L-U, and if you see the E, drop 'em
It's like they dropped E from the beats E's dropping
Got your peeps eavesdropping and the world keeps watching him
(Huh c ya'll)
I see 'em checking out the scenery, they seem to be jocking him
Chicks scream his name out from the bleachers like they proud of him (Blue)
A product of a God-fearing pastor who was quick to whip my ass but his whoppings wasn't hot enough
So I flow conscious but still rep the Koochie Monstas
And still crush the competition no kid is hotter than (Blu)
Your momma's kitchen, beg your pardon darling listen
I'm a nigga on a mission and these bitches ain't stopping him

[Chorus]
Blu (Stop jocking him)
Blu, My world is Blu

[Verse 2: Blu]
So you can ride if you want nigga
I skipped class in school a few times but I ain't dumb nigga
Pitched grass too a few times but I don't pump nigga
Never was the fastest in class but if you put me on the track
I was guaranteed to run niggas
Like back when I was a young spitter
Bitches used to ask me kick a flow to em
Next thing you know I'm stroking em
But I was into older ones kind of like my teachers
On the first day of school I would say it's nice to meet ya I'm...


[Chorus]
Blu, (But you can call me)
Blu, (I ain't stopping till)
My world is Blu

[Verse 3: Blu]
And my mission's just beginning call it Genesis
I'm God's eye messenger but the devil's nemesis, It's no better predicament
I'm straightenin' out the facts cause you twisting it
Nigga this a Bridgetown crown rocker not a fake affiliate
I been in many cliques but this is where soldiers are bred
And many members fell off cause they didn't know the ledge cause
They heads got gassed up, they still ain't got no drive
I'ma ride till I crash and I still ain't got a ride
I move slow cause bro I got a lot on my mind
That's why I'm quick to get to pieces when I'm jotting my lines
Still grinding at the drop of a dime
Trying to rob the world for every cent cause shit I owe a lot to my moms
And I ain't stopping till I change it for my 5 little sisters
Cause the view from their window consist of strippers and hookers
And all my brothers see is the pushers, hustlers and killers
So I walk down blocks as if the sun had called me nigga
Mad at the world
But Nas told me it was mine right before Halftime
But it's 4th quarter and we just getting it
Lying for the benefits
I told you If I wrote I'm sticking with every cent of it
Cause if it goes down I'ma be sinking with my penmanship...just like a captain
And you can only imagine how much passion that I put in this
But some magazines try to rate me on how good it is
Please fuck a critic nigga this is my life; if you ain't put in it
Don't think I need your two cents now like you been pushing it
Cause opinions are assholes; They full of shit
And everybody's got one, if not they trying to cop one
I'm balancing my options...
I can be hustling on the block or moving rocks like It's under construction
Or really busting for change cause I want to come out of these boots
Like I'm superman here to save the day
And hear the crowd screaming my name
Like, ""look up on the stage it's a bird, it's a plane""
No nigga that's, (Blu)"
Below the Heavens,,male,The Narrow Path,"[Intro]
Tryna tell my folks that flowing ain't easy

[Verse 1]
Picture me sitting in front of eighty-eight keys trying to escape
From a shady place where babies blaze trees on a daily day
Tryna get they gravy straight to floss, Co$$ told me homey watch it
These ladies play dirty games when you get to grinding
Where niggas pitch as quick as Nolan Ryan
Holding iron, blowing smoke, elope in fire, flame spitting
The game is just a way to escape
And our pain is just a way we can relate to folks crying
Finding ways I can make a difference
But fuck wishing on a star
Cause the percentage of getting what you envisioned is small
And the stars barely shine in the city, so we’re blinded
By the man-made bright lights, making my eyes shifty
Feel me out, hear me now, crying childs of the ghetto
Letting go a beautiful sound, it’s kinda falsetto
Hello hell, welcome to L.A. where devils that dwell play
They meddle with metal and letting every shell spray
Until day dawns, I make songs for the long road travelers
And lost souls after us
Spitting lyrics vicious like I’m mad as fuck
Packing up my bags, hopping back on the narrow path that’s planned for us


[Chorus]
Tryna tell my folks that flowing ain't easy
Traveling down this yellow brick road until it frees me
I need a pen, I need a pad, I need a place to go
To get this shit lifted off a my soul
Tryna tell my folks that flowing ain't easy
Traveling down this yellow brick road until it frees me
I need a pen, I need a pad, I need a place to go
To get this shit lifted off a my soul

[Verse 2]
In this world that I'm living in
I've given into sex, stress, and dividends
Los Angeles, metropolis, city of vexed citizens
Folks that smoke infinite dope, and hope living in
Poverty is probably the less stressed position to go
So we don’t have positions to hold
So we pitch snow and live in the cold in hell
Inhaling, feeling heaven is close
But like roadkill I'm still on this road
Bold as any soldier playing his role
I stroll the streets in the cold
Even in summer heat it gets cold
So we strolling with the heat and it's cold
It’s been a long troublesome road and im still traveling
And fuck battling, just managing life is challenging
Though I managed to make it
I damaged the places up in my mind
Like the times of Los Angles greatest
Wasting time, wasting lifespans fucking around
I'm spitting deep shit stuck underground
So just dig it, or don't fuck with it
Cause you can't fuck with it


[Chorus]
Tryna tell my folks that flowing ain't easy
Traveling down this yellow brick road until it frees me
I need a pen, I need a pad, I need a place to go
To get this shit lifted off a my soul
Tryna tell my folks that flowing ain't easy
Traveling down this yellow brick road until it frees me
I need a pen, I need a pad, I need a place to go
To get this shit lifted off a my soul

[Verse 3]
Check it, and I'll be playing ""Escapism"" by Pete Rock
Hot, watching police plot knocks to get my peeps locked
Smiling as my teeth rot from eating sugar coated quotes
Smoking dope to float away, but hey
The air is nice up there
I swear the feeling's good as chilling with a nice cold beer
We fallen angels rocking halo's like it's priced up gear
And if you need me, just ring me, shit I'll be right up here
Where fear is non-existent
Instead of drifting in a prison, where my mind's restricted
Where my Mom is wishing trying to get her broken promise mended
I'm training to be a seamstress, sewing holes that dreams fit
Fiends bring broken clocks, tryna get their dreams fixed
Ticking, itching, tocking watching, God is watching you
But you rather have a watch with lots of diamonds I've been fooled
By the word a few times, but who cares if Blu rhymes
About hoes or saving souls, they wanna hear that beat ride
I rewind and try to play back the days that they would play stacks
Of 8-tracks to recline, now we blaze sacks
Taking back the feeling hidden in me when we used to smile, remember that
It's been a while, so I'm blowing off the dust
Brushing dirt up off my nuts, got this feeling in my gut
Im tryna let it out so if you with me listen up, listen
Listen up cause uh, I got this feeling in my gut
What the fuck?


[Chorus]
Tryna tell my folks that flowing ain't easy
Traveling down this yellow brick road until it frees me
I need a pen, I need a pad, I need a place to go
To get this shit lifted off a my so"

The soul provider, gotta lot on the skillet
Grilling it hard-boiled, charcoal filling
The dark villain and the light-skinned niggas disguised
My mind's sickening, define vicious written in rhymes
Times tens-it, to describe how my line's ending
Your fine imprint, described through your mind's index
My line chin-checks, and shine through your blinds, instant
The sun syndicate, fat as Biggie with no Pun intended
No pun intended to live, I pick up where we slid and run illest
Til I buckle and become winded
And all the air from out my lungs slips into the sky like weed smoke
My peoples need hope, and I'm the one with it
The soul provider, cold as fire, hot as ice
Rock the mic til I retire, die the son of Christ
Becoming one with life, to live like death is uncertain
One curtain left and I'mma die with my gun bursting
Tongue cursing til I must become one with the Earth
Heaven and hell I conquer, whichever comes first
Known to rebel, my soul a la mode
My soul a la mode, the soul provider

""Cause I know I got that soul""

[Verse 2: Blu]
Sacred living, sinning like you can't forgive him
Suspending time with my time spent rhyming about nonsense
Like saving religion, drink sipping, letting my mind spin
Thinking about my mom and pops, how they designed this nigga
Mix of Al Green and Pac, rock the soul tracks
Rapping about surviving on the block, black top, asphalt talk
Walking through the fire like a soul provida'
Poppa made a dope rhymer
I'ma ghetto nigga sipping liquor in pajamas
Not old enough to rock clubs but still do
Real soul provider, I gotta ill crew
And best believe they with me in the city like sex
Metropolitan connects, plus the steel crew still do dirt
Baggy jeans and my ill blue shirt
Feeling fresh, yes, while Ex' queue the keys
I'mma ease through your soul, like you're blowing trees
Best believe the soul provider


[Chorus: Scratches]
""Imma hit you with the words that'll make your soul vibe""

""From the soul y'all""

I flow krypton, knock your Superman off his feet with his kicks on
Niggas keep my shit on repeat, and no matter which song I get on
I shit on beats, pull out my dick and take a piss on trees
I'm raw dogging it, look, my rhyme lines flow sweeter than swine
So any mic that I find, I got the right to be hogging it
Talking shit, loud mouth, wild out, starting it
Alcoholic slaughtering my vocab department
So pardon if my talking is slurred, pants sagging
Hands grabbing on my nuts, clutch sparking my herb
Relaxed lingo, beef low, ghetto as Black bingo
Redefine the lines of rap singles
The soul provida', hold the mic and open fire
Drop my nuts, I give a fuck about a pro hire
The new Pete and C.L. was Exile and B-L
We bang jeeps to break beats, blaze trees and females
You ain't me
It's the S-O, U-L pro-vide your mind, with a West Coast soul vibe
It's the S-O, U-L pro-vide your mind, with a West Coast soul vibe
Yeah the soul provider

Allow the flow to blow the steam, hostile

You might have tried if you could but it might have been
You like a bitch fall why the bling
Saying how that shit go, my cockiness keen
Niggas tryna get this cold, put rocks their rings
It's like my face on they wrist cloaked
But them lines so tight they slit throats at shows
Hit your lights at midnight

We light it up in the air while you twist mics
11 steps to Heaven's in here, get your bitch right

Cuz' I'll arrive in the height of the night
Spitting that spice that'll widen your wife
And have her asking you ""Why don't we fight?
So I can leave and be with Blu, cuz' he sliding me right""
See I done put the fear of God up inside of her twice
So ain't nothin' you could tell her that is wiser, aight?
My shit is dynamite, I'll probably die on the mic
You out dining the mic
Just lyin' life
So I'mma lie in your light
Take the lime from your life
And shine bright as a diamond with dimes dying as dykes
Tryna find that feeling I give her night after night
You left out, now I'm righter than right
And every rhyme that I write is like you writing a rhyme
Feeling my lines like life
Rising as high as my high without lighting the lye

When the rules say a minute left, I'll put you in the dark
I brought shadow for them nigga steps, give 'em best regards
Charged it to the game 'til they put a hold on his card
Crash knuckle, back up or catch a uppercut or two
Got knocked but got right back up to bust a few
High shot, moms and pops broke up, so fuck rules

It seems like yesterday we was chasing an ice cream truck
Now we hoping that our ice bling plush
Which is kinda crazy right
One minute you're a baby and the next
You sexin' without protection
And now you're holdin' a baby like
Damn, I was just in your shoes
Now you the papa that's adjustin' they shoes
Teach them to walk straight
Cause honestly they got a long way to go
And what you tell 'em now is all that they know
See I remember when my folks said, ""You'll know what I mean when you get older""
I was only a teen, thinking that I was a grown-up, please, I had so much to see
Thinking the little that I saw was all the world had to offer to me
At 18 I headed off into the streets without guidance
Just the eyes of God watching over me it's time
I spent hours working 9 to 5's to survive
Me and Jack up in the shack started hustlin' sacks
Just to eat chips and soda
Thinking we finna blow up, once this demo gets done
We gon be stretched out rich, riding limos and such
Boy I was just a dreamer
Rocking shows like we went gold, you shoulda seen us
We was full of youth, not yet abused by time
Its like I saw the whole world through my rhymes
Its kinda crazy right?

[Verse 2: Blu]
This reminds me of junior high, when you and I first met
'96 was a year that I could never forget
Sunset summer school dance kisses chicken heads
Spreadin rumors, ""Blu's cheatin' on Shameka with Anika""
We was bad, ditching class
Grass had us all gassed
I never smoked, played ball thought it would make me choke
By the way we lost the championship game by one
Slow fucker hit a 3 at the buzzer
My heart sunk I started crying, I was tryna be a pro baller
My first fuck was that year and still I don't call her
My own father brought me to her house that weekend
He was cheating so I lost my big V while he was beatin
In the other room, not yet abused by time
I saw the whole world through that girl's eyes
Its kinda crazy though


(How time flies)

[Verse 3: Blu]
How it flies....
My grandpa died the same year
My mom thought that I was too young to make this song
Because I'm only 22, but John Barnes has a long path behind him
I'm walkin in the shoes of a giant
And I was a fan of Jordan way before I knew Bryant
Lost my great grey suit but I was through crying
So I hear tears behind my suit and tie and
Now you can find it through my rhyming
Cause my timing has come
And you gon know my whole story by the time I get done
Rising like the shining sun
Reminding you how we came
We rich now but used to be slaves
We pushing whips now we used to be whipped
Rockin chains when we used to be in 'em
Still complaining that we victims of the system
Shit is twisted but shit
We came a long ass way
Yet it just feels like one long day
Shit amazes me....

(How time flies)

I stagger in the gatherin', possessed by a patter-in that be scatterin'
Over the global, my vocals be travelin', unravelin' my abdomen
It's slime that's babblin' grammatics that are masculine
I grab the men, verbally badgering broads
I wish that Madelyne was back on Video LP
I went against all odds and got a even steven
Proceed to read and not believin' everything I'm readin'
But my brain was bleedin', needin' feedin', and exercise
I didn't seek the best of buys, it's a lie to textualize
I analyze where I rest my eyes
And chastise the best of guys with punchlines
I'm Nestle when it's crunch-time
For your mind like one time
If poetry was pussy I'd be sunshine
'Cause I deliver like the Sun-Times
Confined in once-mines on dumb rhymes I combine
I'm hype like I'm unsigned, my diet I un-swine
Eating beef sometimes -- I try to cut back on that shit
This rap shit is truly outta control
My style is too developed to be arrested
It's the freestyle, so now it's out on parole
They tried to hold my soul in a holding cell so I would sell
I bonded with a break and had enough to make bail
A Mr. Meaner fell on his knee for the jury
I asked No for his ID and the judge thought there was two of me
Motion for a recess to retest my fingerprints
They relinquished Sense, 'cause I was guilty in a sense


[Scratched Hook]
""Resurrection""

[Verse 2]
I ride the rhythm like a Schwinn bike when in dim light
I use insight to enlight devices hit the skin tight
Words of wisdom wail from my windpipe, imagination's in flight
I send light, like Ben's kite, I've been bright
Get open like on gym nights and in fights I send rights
Don't hook with skins my friends like, I spend nights up in dykes
In spite, I've been indicted as a freak of all trades
(Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo) I got it made
I bathe in bass lines, rinse in riffs, dry in drums
Come from a tribe of bums hooked on Negro and mums
Had to halt with the, malt liquor
'Cause off the malt liquor, I fought niggas
Now my speech and thoughts quicker
Cruise the Southside streets with no heat and no sticker
UAC got my back and we don't get no thicker
UAC got my back and we don't get no thicker
UAC got my back and we don't, now check it
I'm a ho but not a ho nigga, ain't scared of no nigga
When it's my turn to go, I gotta go
And I'm gone with the storm

Resurrection,,male,I Used to Love H.E.R.,"[Produced by No I.D.]

[Chorus]
A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
To the beat, y'all, and you don't stop
Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
A-one, two, y'all, and you don't stop
A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
And to the beat Com Sense'll be the sure shot, come on

[Verse 1]
I met this girl when I was ten years old
And what I loved most, she had so much soul
She was old school when I was just a shorty
Never knew throughout my life she would be there for me
On the regular, not a church girl, she was secular
Not about the money, those studs was mic-checkin' her
But I respected her, she hit me in the heart
A few New York niggas had did her in the park
But she was there for me, and I was there for her
Pull out a chair for her, turn on the air for her
And just cool out, cool out, and listen to her
Sittin' on a bone, wishin' that I could do her
Eventually if it was meant to be, then it would be
‘Cause we related, physically and mentally
And she was fun then, I'd be geeked when she'd come around
Slim was fresh, yo, when she was underground
Original, pure, untampered, a down sister
Boy, I tell you, I miss her


[Chorus]
A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
To the beat, y'all, and you don't stop
A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
A-one, two, y'all, and you don't stop
A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
A-Com Sense y'all, and you don't stop
A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
UAC, yo, we gotta be the sure shot

[Verse 2]
Now periodically I would see
Ol' girl at the clubs, and at the house parties
She didn't have a body, but she started gettin' thick quick
Did a couple of videos and became Afrocentric
Out goes the weave, in goes the braids, beads, medallions
She was on that tip about stoppin' the violence
About my people she was teachin' me
By not preachin' to me but speakin' to me
In a method that was leisurely, so easily I approach
She dug my rap, that's how we got close
But then she broke to the West Coast, and that was cool
Cause around the same time, I went away to school
And I'm a man of expandin', so why should I stand in her way?
She probably get her money in L.A
And she did stud, she got big pub, but what was foul
She said that the pro-black was goin' out of style
She said, ""Afrocentricity was of the past""
So she got into R&B, hip-house, bass, and jazz
Now black music is black music and it's all good
I wasn't salty she was with the boys in the hood
Cause that was good for her, she was becomin' well-rounded
I thought it was dope how she was on that freestyle shit
Just havin' fun, not worried about anyone
And you could tell by how her titties hung


[Chorus]
A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
To the beat, y'all, and you don't stop
A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
A-one, two, y'all, and you don't stop
A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
And to the beat Com gotta be the sure shot
A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
If you don't check it, mm-mm, bust it, bust it

[Verse 3]
I might've failed to mention that this chick was creative
Once the man got to her, he altered her native
Told her if she got an image and a gimmick
That she could make money, and she did it like a dummy
Now I see her in commercials, she's universal
She used to only swing it with the inner-city circle
Now she be in the burbs, lookin' rock and dressin' hippie
And on some dumb shit when she comes to the city
Talkin' bout poppin' Glocks, servin' rocks and hittin' switches
Now she's a gangsta rollin' with gangsta bitches
Always smokin' blunts and gettin' drunk
Tellin' me sad stories, now she only fucks with the funk
Stressin' how hardcore and real she is
She was really the realest, before she got into showbiz
I did her, not just to say that I did it
But I'm committed (girl, he's committed) but so many niggas hit it
That she's just not the same lettin' all these groupies do her
I see niggas slammin' her and takin' her to the sewer
But I'ma take her back, hopin' that the shit stop
‘Cause who I'm talkin' about, y'all, is hip-hop


[Chorus]
To the beat, y'all, and you don't stop
A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
Mainframe, yo, they gotta be the sure shot
A-yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
To the beat, y'all, and you don't stop
A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
A-one, two, Com Sense is gonna drop, haha

"
Resurrection,,male,Watermelon,"Verse 1]
I express like an interstate
Hyper when I ventilate
My rap pieces penetrate and infiltrate your mental state
Just to reiterate
That I innovate
Bonin' broads when they men-estruate
I spend a great time with the rhyme
More than I did any female
I derailed your train of thought
Because your brain was caught
On some other man's thinking
Now your third eye is blinking
My rhymes be kicking like a brother's breath be stinking
I get funky for sure while you're *sniff* unsure
If you got beef, chief, then let that shit unthaw
This track was a broad
I'd be bonin the shit out of it
Bang, bang, bang then see what I can get out of her
Probably some scratch clothes and some J's
I got six million ways to rhyme
Choose one
I stand out like a nigga on a hockey team
I got goals, and I can like a pop machine
I come clean
Like a fiend in Chi I'm down with rehab
Stir my style crazy
Cause that's right, we bad, we bad
Pryor to Richard I was that crazy nigga
Cause I kick ass
And when I wreck it other rappers be like ""whiplash!""


[Verse 2]
It's like I come to the party in a b-boy stance
I rock on the mic and make the girls want to dance
I come to the party in a b-boy stance
I rock on the mic and make the girls want to dance
Me without a lyric, is like a nigga without a beeper
I'm a blow this shit out, cuz I'm the joint like reefer
If Barry White was in the mob
I still would be deeper
Cause I had lyrics back when I used to run with Keyvin
MC's step to me, butt-ass naked like ""What's up?""
I said, ""You know you done fucked up
Now I'm sayin, ""You know you done fucked up""
Everybody that hear me say I'm jams like the NBA
Cause I'm on fire
If I was a Michelin I wouldn't tire
It's funny how time flies
Well I'm as fly as time
I don't believe in role models
But if I do, then I'm mine
I make brothers say ""True""
They see you and be like ""Fiction""
I want 'spect and dead presidents
Like Richard Nixon
I'm a coach not a player
Not a gay mc, I'm straighter
My style is similiar to AIDS
You can f with it now
But catch you later
You can't touch this, cuz this is what I'm feelin bro
I'm the man, you need me I'll be on the fifth flo'
Just chillin'
Even if it's played out it's not the word to play so peace
I'm out to Dirty Burgers I'mma give my change to Reese"

{Here's a little that must be told
(*beat scratches*)
From beginning to end (*beat scratches*)
Here's a little story that must be told (*beat scratches*)
From beginning to end}

[Verse 1]
I got so much trouble on my mind
So I take time out my day
To pray and I say, now lay me down to sleep
Hopin' that I keep my soul
Peep, I'm gettin' old and this a cold, cold world
And I ain't even got a bomber
Livin' with my momma, it's the same routine
Keep my room clean, I'm lookin' to do some new things
But ain't shit to do
I'm twenty-two, catch
In the prime of my life, I have no time for a wife
I funnel through the tunnel, disgruntled
Tryin' to find me some light
In the rim of darkness, I too sing
I may not be the darkest, brother
But I was always told to act my age, not my color
Not knowin' that my color, was out of the original
So now I sing the new negro spiritual
It goes, 'get up, stand up
Stand up for your rights
Get up, stand up
Don't give up the fight
It's like, how can you understand the pain
When you never had to stand under the rain?
When it rains, it pours
And it's about to come down hard, thank God
I found you


[Hook 2]

{sample: my life, my life, my life, my life}
{Double Trouble: here's a little story that must be told}
{sample: my life, my life}
{Double Trouble: from beginning to end}

[Verse 2]
As I walk down the road of existence
I get resistance from all angles
I tangle for cash
Hopin' it'll last 'til the end of the week
But all I eat is fast food
And you know how junk food goes right through ya
So I return *to* the a-rab, then on the way back
I stop- at the liquor store, grab me a six pack
Knowin' that once I'm done with that I'll be back
To get some more
Once I get started I don't wanna stop (ahh...)
And I can't turn around, brew- I can't turn it down
Ironically I turn it up, my liver I burn it up
It's my life I live it up, the cup I gotta give it up
One day
I'm cruisin' down a one-way street
And I done passed *fun* day- three blocks ago
It itself, life is an obstacle
As I maneuver through the manure I try to be responsible
I want a job but I ain't lookin' (how come?)
I ain't tryin' to degrade myself, bein' nobody's Calvin I'm a couch bum
What makes it bad, I had incentive
But that disintegrated to a state that stagnated
I procrastinated
I can't recall a day without bein' intoxicated, or blowed
I'm dealin' with a full deck, at any day I can fold
What makes it bad, I wasn't dealt that bad a hand
And I had a plan
But things didn't go through
The way they were supposed to
Thank God I found you

[Verse 3]
It's like a jungle, sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under, I ponder
And try to keep my
Concentration In this idiotic nation
They say become a doctor, but I don't have the patience
Adjacent to that situation
I want an occupation that I'm into
Cause yet have I begin to
Live to my potential, I went to
School for fourteen years and my best teacher was experience, I reminisce
And wish, I could go back in time to eighty-nine
When there was just' 'sunshine'
But now it's like, I'm gettin' older there's so much strain and stress
I don't think I'll ever be happy until I rest in peace
Of mind, and find who I am
But thank God I found you

[Verse 1: No I.D]
No time to get all excited, just write it
From the inside let the pen slide, and spread
The ink on the papyrus, come understand this (what?)
Paint the canvas, givin' you my vision
To mold you, compose you
Get a picture of the scene, then get an exposure
Words out my cipher, the life of my circle
Pain trapped inside of me, Cabrini to Ida B., don't lie to me
You want me in your needle
Squirt me in your vein, maintain on the couch
I excite your brain til I'm out of your system
Beat digger, not a nigga or a niggaro
I figure you're the winner of the bread
Precede your thoughts 'fore they come into your head
(Yo, kid kinda nice)
From the word, I speak, unique, clear and concise
Heads I'm boring, soaring to a new height of flight
And then fight the night
With a light to gain sight make your competition say aight
No I.D. from the city with a beach on thirty-first
Making all butt crews disperse
I'm in my own world

I say pay attention boy, I say uk look at here
I want you to see me; when you do, you look in fear
I dilate pupils that's cornea than a retina
My Book of Life you felt it, because of the texture
When I'm bubbly I call the ex ta, see if she still love me
I'm advanced like a copy studs be on my sac to dub me
Cheap ass niggas, go and purchase it
I ain't do all this work for shit
My style's my child I gave birth to it
Like an immaculate conception, clean I came
Went through label pains, didn't give shorty a name
I put, bros before hoes that's the way love and life goes
It's a Jungle out there but I'm never Fever-in for them white hoes
I love black thighs, you sisters better realize
The real hair and real eyes get real guys
So before you makeup your face, you better make up your mind
I hope you wake up in time for the revolution, or you gon' be like
""I can't believe it! I got shot!""
Bowe, so I lick one, not for Riddick
But I got the Rid, for my dick
And the crab MC's that be all over it
Huh, what good is the Rid without the comb?
I'm the street pick peace to Nick, Tim, Mark and Kendall
I remember me and Dion tried to get into Mendel
I didn't have No I.D., they wouldn't let me in
Now them same gumps be askin' me to get them in
I be like, ""You don't know me... fool""
And color him purple (why?), 'cause he ain't in my circle

Here they are

[Verse 1: Butterfly]
The ticky-ticky buzz, the sun wakes the sky
I fumble through my fuzz and buzz Mister I
Tell him scoop the beats in the flying saucer kit
Meet me at the port with the nickel bags and shit
Told my pops I'm out, earthbound with the crew
He said, ""Butterfly, may the boogie be with you""
Left my moms a note with these quotes on the trunk
It says, ""I split to Earth to resurrect the funk""
A dozen Snapple pops and a little box of eats
Travellin' through space with the funky, funky beats
Stopped at Pluto to cop some petrol
Met some Klingons and got our things on
Cruising Warp Six with Mister Wiggles in the mix
Hendrix passin' P, Star Child get the fix
The saucer shook the heavens with the blooms and the blams
Because when we hit New York, shazam
We droppin' like a comet and this Vulcan tried to Spock it
These Martians tried to do it, but knew they couldn't cop it
The others from our brother planet lands in the flesh
From up in Sector Six, yes, y'all

[Verse 2: Doodlebug, Ladybug, & Both]
And it's good to be here when we landed up on Lex
Stirrin' up the ground with the sound of Doug E. Fresh
And the hard rocking kids that did it for the black
With the Pumas on their feet and the bombers on their back
We learned it and we earned it, so you know you got to hand it
We planned it when we left, how to freak it and to slam it
Add a Ladybug, transformation is complete
For the metamorphosis from the box to the Jeep
And it's good to be here, gettin' fly with the raps
We love it where we from, but we kick it where we at
Bumpin' out with somethin' that pops and transcends
DPs, baby, it's slim, but not thin
In amongst the pebbles, we rocks on your blocks
Soakin' in the ghetto for kids that have not
Slappin' on some skin, when we slam, check the cheers
So we greet their virgin ears with a kiss
It's so good to be here


[Bridge: All]
We jazz up the streets to prove we have beats
Fat jazz, fat styles, and the sound so sweet
And there ain't no doubt that you got to check
Doodle, Silk, Butter, Mecc
It's so good to be here

[Verse 4: Butterfly]
Yeah, baby, that's the style
The jazz can fill a club or papers by the pile
Just ask toy soldier, toy soldier could have told you
At the boomin' funk hut, it was the afro with the butt
So to the flam lovers that crowd in dark spots
To see 'em kick that lingo and grip that little crotch
Now we have arrived with crazy boogie sounds
Get yourself a mate, today's to boogie down
This is all we know, you feel it when we slams
You can hear the love, it comes out in our jams
The hip-hop digging cats just delivering the words
From the ghetto-dwelling youth, to the bourgies in the burbs

[Outro: All]
And it's good to be here, it's good to be here
It's good to be here, yeah, it's good to be here
It's good to be here, it's good to be here
It's good to be here, yeah, it's good


[Skit: Butterfly, Ladybug]
Good evening, insects
Humans too
The Cocoon Club is pleased to present to you tonight, a new band
Straight from Sector Six
And the colorful ghettos of outer space
They're some weird motherfuckers, but they do jazz it up
So let's bring 'em out here, yeah
Uh, thank you, thank you, word, cross
Ever since I was a caterpillar I dreamed of, you know, slamming up Earth, so we're gonna try to do it tonight
Let me introduce you to the insects, the players to you
On life, my main man, this cat is bad, check him out
C-Know, the Doodlebug, alright
On wide grooves, Silkworm
On vibes— What? What?
Yo, chill, man
I don't even know you, man, what you talking about?
Yo, bring it back, bring it back, right now
Yeah, as I was saying, on vibes, waves, and feelings, the Ladybug, Miss Mecc, yeah
Yeah, on P's and pleasing poetry
And on thoughts and tongue, and a little bit of actions, yours truly, Mister Butterfly
The mind is time, the mind is space
A horn rush, a bass flush, for minds to taste
So sit back, enjoy the set
Yeah
The mind is time, the mind is space
A horn rush, a bass flush, for minds to taste
The mind is time, the mind is space
A horn rush, a bass flush—"

Butterfly searching for a relax
Pulling from the jazz stacks 'cause it's Sunday
On the air is incense, sounds to the ceiling
Tried to get this feeling since Monday
Looking out the window watching all the people go
Bugging off a funny vibe 'cause now it seems they're equal
Wonder what would Trane say, wonder what my pop say
Bugging off the calmness in the Apple
Who me I'm cooling in New York
I'm chilling in New York
The hoods is on my block and the brother's at the court
The baseball hats is on and the projects is calm
Dreamtime's extended (and highly recommended)
But early birds like me's up checking out the scene
The early worms jog, forget about your job
Just come dig the essence while the decadence is hidden
When people act like people, the theory is in pigeon
If you know the norm it's like Hades transformed
On Sunday's early hours the city sprouts its flowers
So get with the rhythms while you getting with the Planets
Vibe off the jams but don't take em for granted, just chill

[Refrain]
New York is red hot, New York is red hot
New York is red hot, New York is red hot



[Verse 2: Butterfly, Doodlebug, and Ladybug]
We venture through the streets in search of funky beats
Extensive is the travels and it's heavy on the sneaks
Yeah it's kicking out the speakers of the Sunday morning jeepers
My man do Planets do it lovely?
Am I my brother's keeper?
We foot it to the park where the swoon units walk
And sit with the Phoenicians digging on musicians
Hanging with the rebels sipping on a Snapple
Bugging with my crew just tripping in the Apple
You be thinking peace when you're vibing with your flock
But you be thinking damn everybody got a Glock
If you got some beef please express that in silence
Or else... violence
But right here is the life, it's the children of the concrete
Living off the fruits and the functions of the fat beats
Hip-hop's all around, the members is growing
Please dig on the sounds 'cause the good vibes they snowing, so chill

[Refrain]
New York is red hot, New York is red hot
New York is red hot, New York is red hot
New York is red hot, New York is red hot
New York is red hot, New York is red hot

[Verse 3: Butterfly]
Wake up, praying that the game's on
Maybe it's the Runnin' Rebs, maybe it's the Knicks
Maybe it's a rerun of an old TV show
Like Hawaii 5-0 or karate flicks
Maybe if the phone rings Butterfly will take wings
Speaking on some cool things fronting like I cope
Born unto flat ground now I'm chilling shaky ground
Reaching for Pacific Heights Sunday is my rope, dig it
Sunday's to relax
Sunday's to relax
Some Sunday morning drama is calling up my Mama
The hotline is in I guess the silvers knew the deal
Vibing off the jams of the crews on Sugarhill
Lay around and think ain't nothing to do
Checking out some Fromm, some Sartre, Camus
Mingus' Ah Um, damn Roach can drum
The DP's are life, there they go, here they come
It's time to grab some loot, put on the Timber boots
Checking out some dollies like Tasha and Kamali
New York is a museum with its posters and graffiti
If you're in the city on Sunday
Come check me, get with me

New York is red hot, New York is red hot
New York is red hot, New York is red hot

Peace, peace, peace y'all
Strange
Real strange, real strange
An overdose, a nickel bag of funk
Now move on, move on yeah
Hey man are you ready to go

[Verse 1: Butterfly]
Boogie jive and rap is life where I'm from
Where I'm from, Ahmed play with Izzy where I'm from
Where I'm from, it be like run your coat black
Jupiter, keeps her fat beats by the pack
Where I'm from, nappy hair is life
We be reading Marx where I'm from
The kids be rocking Clarks where I'm from
You turn around your cap, you talk over a beat
And dig some sounds booming out a jeep
Where I'm from, cocoons hide the youth, swoon units hundred proof
You want some beef, they will cut you some where I'm from
The beats is infinite where I'm from
Voodoo, ashubani, gangsta lean where I'm from
I'm interplanetary, my insect movements vary
It's kinky if it's hair, G where I'm from
The fire hoses blow
It's purple when it snow
I do a hit and go, split
It's hip, what's hip
When hip is just the norm
'Cause Planets pledge allegiance to the funk in all its forms
The kinks, the dance, the prints in all the shirts
My grandmother told my Mama that it's Africa at work
On vibes, we freak, them universal beats
You find it at the spot you hit at ends of every week
We twist, exist, to spin the maddest hits
Up here funk is our neighbour so we paid her a visit
The lip we sip can't house the nine zips
For rock we can't do nothing, for this we come equipped
Off disc, off tape, rap blasting til from eight
The really truly fat the fly on the flip
Cocoa gotta know, how Planets gotta roll
Speak the mega cool, get funky as a goal
It's calm, relax, we're only some new jacks
That acts from the funk but don't play the role
Where you from



[Verse 2: Doodlebug]
Weekend Dig Plans got T's where I'm from
Where I'm from, it's Clarence 13 where I'm from
Where I'm from, brothers took the beats and got fly
(Why?) That's most asked by 85, where I'm from
Faking the funk you get did
Projects, tenements, pyramids where I'm from
We living off the boom boom crack
It's that hip-hop rockers, jazz when I max
Peace be the greeting of the insect tribe
Pestilent forces can't catch the vibe
We live to love and we love to rock mics
We speak in ghetto tongue 'cause ghetto's the life
Food for thought so get a buffet plate
The lyrics are so fat you might gain weight
So just watch me step alone, into the sunset
Left foot right foot 1-2 mic check
Brewing funk inside my soul kitchen
So pull up a chair, here's a bib, have a listen
Of hardhead intervene, damn I know you're fluent
Yeah, 'cause Doodle ain't having it and Butterfly knew it
Where you from

[Verse 3: Ladybug]
Venus acts a fool at the square right, yeah
Doctors engineer in a pair right, yeah
Hip-hop made a point last year right, yeah
But Planets is the joint this year right, yeah
Planets got the dubs and live to grass-hop
Duck out from the fuzz, that sweat the hip-hop
Rising like we foam, get it from the dome
I'm from where the fat beats stretch for mad blocks
We can get a kit, without no thread
Feeling funky beats go straight to the head
Fall into a club, dig on what we love
It be past six before we reach bed
Butter freaks on relics we say those are fat
Doodle, Mecc, and Silk, the quad where it's at
We need to stack a sack, for rap to take us dap
So we treat our clips, just like busting caps
Rip it till dawn, kick it till dawn
Hip-Hop is the fix or else we be gone
People thought they canned it
Rap is not by bandits
Digable Planets got it going on

Exit planet Venus for a Brooklyn stroll
Jazzy fly, nappy things, plaits to a roll
Leaves fumble falling down, wind blowing 'round
Dig the layer change, the funkifying sound
Mecca, the Ladybug, changing like seasons
Moves I be seeing, changes life's reasons
On to express the ways that I profess the
Swoon unit glow, as I go; Butter flow
I take a chance, go against the norm
But they used to make advance to my lady form
Ok, shall I smack a ghetto punk with the line?

Check out the funk-brown bass, my man
This be the medium used by Dig Plans
Hit the cosmics like a funkonaut
Leave the ladybugs with forget-Funk-nots
Black sunflowers, broom be your tomb
If sound from the Digs, it'll zoom up your room
Bugs block spots where hip-hop be your norm
If Capri is the Kid, the floor's getting stormed
With the bass in ya face, space is the place
Bugs take a stand, goddamn it's a jam
C-note be no uncivilized just
Poppin' out the jive in the jazz-causing rush
Can you dig it? My mellow, it's that cool cat sound

Shit, that's mandatory, so you gots to demand it

With my crew and shit, honey dip, cool breeze
Can you dig it? (I'm with it) (Butter, now you know)
I know the wig gets the grade out, it's fat or else we'd be out
Copped the rap bats from these cats out on Bleeker
Rejuvenate the plates for my people and they speakers
Nietzsche, Rap, make Anita crutch
Planets wouldn't allow themselves to grow like such
Expressions, sightings, scripting, taught
Finest status quo is being an artist in New York
Tongues be often forked, clothes be often caught
If they call it a fad, we just ignore it like it's pork
Planets got them thoughts blooming flowers in the dense
They said the grass was greener so we snuck and hopped the fence
Landed in a meadow, glimpsed and saw a shadow
Of brothers with guitars, common sense and puffy afros
Lucks was getting brazed, Paps was getting blazed
Feds was cracking domes, but these cats, they wasn't phased
In tights grips, yet their lips was talkin' fun
Rhythms and the struggle kinda funneled into one
True funk cannot disguise, because the streets have eyes
Who's gonna revive? Well us and delic vibe
Did it like a Dig Planet, goddammit
To get a good kick it, suggest ya get ya ticket and...

Thinkin' life is big, is that hip is it norm
Psych-e-delic and fat
Flowers and beads and peaces and naps
Ah yes, planets got the blessed
Beats are played on Friday to get Monday off your chest
Kick live dig into the quotes
Lose yourself and groove in the beauty as it floats
Hair, clothes monochrome it ain't
Many different worlds in the sweet and funky joint
Pounds, hands speakers and jams
Even those that flams get fitted in the plans

Yes we do, uh
Time, space, what is that like
Just how we livin' when in the hip life
Kids, roll with hot buttered soul
From 125 right down to Ludlow
The juice the cup the token fare is up
The ancestors peace with the daughters of the dust
We just freaks, aquafunky beats
Vented to the streets from the boxes and the jeeps

Up on planet Earth we brought the mad bass
Brung is the tongue they all can understand
I'm free so let me pass it to my G

I gain a better reason to smack me up a five
Bald caps, pleasurable naps
Time and space is fake and that's the real haps
Youth flights, land on Friday nights
Birds be with the cats DJ's savin' lives
Soul funk jive and rhythm
Jams be ‘til and 'til, but been funkin’ since 11
Sound drips comin' off the lips
Smuggled from the planets that freak the 9 zips
Time space no one's is alike
Be you and just be you or be out

You're irresponsible, no focus
I hope this advice grips
I ripped it to shreds, I bust heads
With soundwaves and frequencies
Frequently I'm freakin the flows like hoes
At Dancehall shows, rub-a-dub those
Shattering Glass Joes with decibels
To break spectacles, you can't see me
You're feelin' queazy and uneasy
Steppin cautious because you're nauseous
I squashes emcees like I was Colossus
Flippin on Magneto, never metal, without my bending
Ending all existence, my rhymes blending
Niggas up and liquifying, punks are crying
Crews are dying while the mack keeps shining
Gleaming, girls are screaming, 'cause I'm arousing
My styles bring, [?] kids, so hot you lookin drowsy
And drained, refrain from being slain
By my slang, once again I wreck brains

Yo, shit occurs when I shift my words
I dip a Swisher, to my kisser
And get spliffed-a, I riff the

Like a titan, mythical
When I grip or pull
Spliff, it will manipulate my brain
In ways to plot or gain
And raises
Tajai is the brand that
Keep it jam-packed
Frankly pretty damn phat
It's over me, I am enough to rip it flat, and pass
The mic to me and see emcees sadden fast
You're ratty, match my tip, you pips
And Gladys Knight gets darkness
Is where we best scar kids
If ours gets bootlegged and sold in the market
Then mark this
Them stands plan to be targets
And I'll stand grand
Then peace to Richmond and

And squash rhymers to vapor

So crawl back under your rock, get off my jock

Slapped ya, with my rapture
On the down low, I trapped your brain

Now playful pulpit pussies poppin' junk with the pistol
Sweated because I'm dreaded, let's get ready to pull a fistful
Of extinction, reachin’, quick on the trigger sneakin'
And then send a flurry of bullets diggin’ deep in my flesh and wreakin'
The props 'cause they pops lots of mops heads drop
Dead plots, a cop, eager and ready to lick the shots hot
Ready to kick the plot so wipin’ the flop and then I vanish
Managed to escape by the skin of my teeth and then say damn
It's a shame, the brain is washed, to the point, when it's savage
Beasts, I rest in peace, simply before I annex
And send, why can't there be, a resolution I ask you
No answer, so fuck it the next time my life is threatened I'll blast you
Packin’ the black steel makin’ the mack's feel pain and fear
As I smear blood from buckshots to the brain
PUMP PUMP PUMP listen to the bullets hum as they buzz past
Your ears and dig in, drillin’ into your cranium
Not a gang-banger, crack-slanger, never done had the rep kid
Yet sweated, frequently, see me and step with
Intent to kill spilling your blood for your sins
Defends my livelihood 'cause rivals could bring ends to
My youthful bliss bustin’ a trigger gun and missed this
Bullets, to the vital organs, in order to assist
In your death, your last breath havin' spasms as I has em’
The idea is demonic and the thought is surely sad
And not a murderer, ensurin’ the longevity of my life, I'll
Live and let live, kill if I must I shall

Damn I wish, that I can have bliss, daily
Lately I try to speak my piece but words fail me
I'm dwelling in the halls of appalling sights of evil
I got to sweat the devil plus I got to sweat my people
Do I gotta blow them brains out to get them chains out
Your head, the mackin’ mentally offends to be dead
Deceased I gotta a peace deeds 'cause the beast be
Lurkin’ up in them, so now I'm buckin’ them
And stuck in them, the herring fits means tricks
You learn it when you plunder and tell me to run the kicks
You might trip, and find it hard to swallow this
But follow this down a dark alley and you're catchin’ hollow tips
You got yo' shit, I got mine, leave it at that
Respect T or thank me, when I shank thee
Necks, 'cause clever dreads can sever heads weasel
I may be thin but my lead friends be diesel
A law-abiding citizen but shit it's been long enough
Strong and tough, sniff this and you're snuffed
Stifled, step lively, don't try to bust me
Trust the fact that I'm friendly and you'll Plus see
I love humans, they hate, me

Yo, thy shall not kill, I will if I have to
You say I'm the one promoting violence well I ask you
Have you ever heard the sound of bullets passing you
Ever thought of going out with someone blasting you
Willing to be killing maybe is a great sin but
It's not appealing when bullets penetrate skin what
Pain when a brain leaves a stain with the quickness
So I get a fool if I think that I'm on his shit list
With the swiftness of a Glock nine
So now who got your back? 'Cause my gat got mine
Find a brother with some dreads and now you figure you're gonna kill him
Well I grab my gun when I see one I'm gonna fill him
Why should you live in fear thinkin someone is gonna get ya
I bet ya, before he gets me he'll be on a stretcher
So no nigga pulls a trigger on the S-O-M
And if there's more than one I'll have to kill the rest of them
Buckshots, leave a body ripped, 'cause I got equipped
With a shotty quick, that nobody wanna riff with
Get split open with the fury of the lead G
Rat-a-tat, tat-a-tat, flat is what your head be
Dead see, why don't brothers wanna let me function
When I pull it, kids be eatin' bullets like a luncheon
Adam got a magnum and I tag 'em with this weapon
Be threatened, 'cause Adam be pullin' a pistol if you're steppin'
I don't like it but I guess that that's the way it has to be

Yo, I find it fun to smash emcees into fine bits
I’m goin' to get my just deserts for all the kids I must’ve hurt
I trust that courtesy when dealing with folks is too much for the asking
Cool: I got the skill crafted tools
Massive fools at my work bench and
I'm wrenchin' mics from they grasp 'n'
That's how it has been
The drill's this: I kill swift
I feels I better slay or, hey
My tape measures greater
So now I'm askin' dips if they saw me and they was available
Would they want me to nail 'em all?
Be through, screw, drive her crazy; nut and bolt, lively
Put on your high beams

I proliferate a quicker fate to niggas, vigorous
Figure I kick stunts, I punch twice that nigga that's dissin' at me
Attach 'em to bats, latchin', and matchin' my cataclysm
I give'em a schism, I stroke to croak her, I broke her
Chokin' up on my syntax, as I bend backs by im-impacts
Then I give a concussion in your nuts when I'm bustin'
Heads, dead with my lead graff, I cloth thee
I swing off-beat, off the cerebellum, swellin' membranes
Ten brains couldn't parallel this
I'm carouseling kids while they wallow and swallow hollow tips
You follow and slippin' -I'm rippin' mics nice twice

Me and Hiero, I know, I'm fly, bro
So why flow if you're not invigorating?
I know where you live, there at your crib, I got niggas waitin'
I figure raping is crime, see
I take my time B, and now your G is my G
Now I'm gonna show you how the West Coast smacks kids
Yo, I'm rhyming swell, so to hell with a wack diss
Generalizing, dissing before you've ever seen this
So you can get the middle (What middle?)
The penis

Never the match the miraculous tactics
I smack tricks, the wax is at your wack bitch
I crack bricks over dicks
Who can't come, I leave'm broke and dumb
Deaf, and plus I'm causin' cardiac arrest, you need some rest
Check, as I'm chiselin' riddles in your memory
Remember me? I hacked your body to pieces disassembling your flows
You bros started trembling from shock and trauma
I'm gonna, end lives when I bomb-a

Adam is the man that got more honies than a hive of
Bees, I skeeze, I'm pullin stunts like MacGyver
And I try to, always be patient with a Miss
But I diss 'cause groupies always seem to make me pissed
Huh, they gotta be frontin', wantin' to start a phony friendship
I never pretend, the thing I befriend be them hips
And send dips, back to they moms with a grin
But if she's a boo boo head I tell no-one that I got in

[Verse 2: Tajai]
Yo, skins friends I got a lotta, and I gotta
Bend them and then blend all the hottie
Spurts be burstin like a mile a minute
'Cause I can either take it slow or yo I wild up in it
I'm pulling, yes 'cause fully dressed or threadbare they're nice
I twist my sides to tickle thighs when my head's there
I now rips sets so foul dips spread my rep
I sew the girls up like Schweppes, so many kids might fret

[Verse 3: Opio]
Afterwards I'm bouncing dips like tits on chicks
Who be running track, but they be running back for more
Rest assured, it's absurd for her to be on linger
I get the finger, 'cause she can't get the stinger
Any longer, my dong can stretch and I'm stronger
I got the daddy ding-a-ling to get you hot and bothered
Get the kinks out when my stink in the pink shout and scream
But a second fling is but a dream



[Verse 4: Phesto]
From day one I played hoes in the schoolyard, my tool heartless
But not for dips submerging it ain't hurt men to merge in
My status, from baddest to Tims, I'm pulling more hips
Than gravity, and after the skins get hit, I'm drowsing
Arousing the next dousing the next gals in my saliva
The liver ones 'cause I don't strive to run in no dumb females
Some be swell, but, my picks so why tricks
Get restricted to flicks with boo boo heads, I screw you dead

Niggas cling, and get attached to things on the fluke
That's insane, I just be in and bang, get boots
For gosh sakes, that broad shakes, her thang to the whole game
The way the labia lips hang it's a sad shame
Clapping when you're tapping, just hit the scraps and be at 'em
The breasts sag like they're saddened
The skins are wrinkled, dry, worn, and battered
Leave her shattered, she's as fly as a maggot


[Verse 6: Phesto]
The him I am, the man I'm him
Bustin' skins out, I been stout, erect
Checkin' dips when I'm wreckin' lips and clitorises
Hit her with this [(Boom bow bang!)]
Swinging from my you-know-what
So you know butt cheeks are clapping
Tapping the guts on the late with your date makes my ego flip
Read those lipstick marks on my penal tip
They don't lie, penis trip your dip to her thighs
Fly is my description, wise, when I'm making them lips bend

[Verse 7: A-Plus]
I hit it, I did it, I admit it
I never quit it, yes, I knock the boots like I was Riddick
Bowe, get with it, ho, I get with
No, Boomerang broads with nasty toes
Keep your corns on your husk you muskrat
But if she's fly, I try to bust that
Gluteus maximus, I wax and bust
I'm taxin' just to be the mack man Plus

[Tajai]
Once I been with women, friendship done been the sole outcome
How come skins can't work their way in?
The question resting late night at her pad and
Scheming to grabbing season, 'cause she's in
I fiend, getting mad horny, transforming charges
Into swinging me, seemingly hard miss
Let her know that I was on it
Now I got dibs on that crib, I'm welcome back 'cause I'm Kotter

I might be ill and my mic it steals that old beyonder shit
I palm this shit, what's seen next is keen text

To rock the masses, whippin niggas asses
At last it's, appropriate to show that I can blast kids
I'm quick to stick a dick in skin
I'm figuring I hinder men, so let's sin, and watch this nigga win
I'm making corpses, of course I score kids
I'm morbid, 'cause it makes me think of more shit to kick

From being beat, I freak lifting syllables
So kill the bullcrap, I'm arousing, dousing, drowning
When my sound swings, I found things
To bequeath, you're beneath, you need relief, to be brief
I crushed ya, flushed ya, from the cypher
'Cause I sliced your life to pieces
In ruins, I screw in, skills like drills
So who and, what army can harm me?
Kill the noise, my boys never lack poise
But you wack toys get played as I slay

My stick drives you crazy flip it backwards and it plays the
Satanic messages, I guess it is my nature
To break your mental barriers to take your body over
Drove y, off a cliff, I got the gift to shapeshift
I encourage say nigga suicidal
The shit I write'll, make you clutch a bible
I got the Cali type styles, I wipe smiles
And smirks off of jerks 'cause that weak shit don't never work

I'll stay blessing mics; my followers pay homage

[Chorus: Substantial and Pase Rock]
Substan, blessing it; yes, I am, blessing it
UV for life Hell yes, we stay blessing it
Pase, I'm blessing it; Yes, I stay blessing it
Five Deez forever, you know we stay blessing it
Substan, blessing it; yes, I am, blessing it
UV for life Hell yes, we stay blessing it
Pase, I'm blessing it; Yes, I stay blessing it
Five Deez forever, you know we stay blessing it


[Verse 2: Pase Rock]
On point like the pens we write with
Living righteous in these times of peril and crisis
The pain'll squeeze you lifeless (Dead)
What's it matter who's the nicest?
Who's alive, who's gonna live to see their life is
Hopefully me
My lifeline of emcee extends past to paying dues—how much it cost to be free?
Deep-rooted underground, but on the surface, a tree
Branching out—all I ever really wanted to be
They want to put us in a box and then pack it away
But we ain't having that, no pause, no which way
Yo, I'm going to the top and that's where I'll stay
Fuck the middle ground
Cold, getting biz while you was sitting down
The joint sound hitting now, freestyle or written down
Your flow is played out, money—you need to get that shit in style
Speedy on the quick, fast; Long-term we make it last
Forever in a daze, stay clear of the path 'cause, yo

[Chorus: Substantial and Pase Rock]
Substan, blessing it; yes, I am, blessing it
UV for life Hell yes, we stay blessing it
Pase, I'm blessing it; Yes, I stay blessing it
Five Deez forever, you know we stay blessing it
Substan, blessing it; yes, I am, blessing it
UV for life Hell yes, we stay blessing it
Pase, I'm blessing it; Yes, I stay blessing it
Five Deez forever, you know we stay blessing it


[Verse 3: Substantial and Pase Rock]
Children of the Sun, look out, here we come
Live in Brooklyn; Maryland's where I'm from
We don't stop (Uh) 'til you've had enough
Five Deez, UV connect—that's what's up
Children of the sun, watch out, we're coming for ya
Rocking from the 'nati mid-west to California
And it don't stop even when you've had enough
Pase and Substantial, dude, that's what's up
Blessing it effortless; testing this? Doubt it
Mic specialist, son; we kept events crowded
As nice as you wish you were, ripped mics are my signature
Thought you said your shit is hot—it's barely room temperature
We're scorching, torturing cats from Cincinnati to New York and back
Word to Pat, don't say jack
When we bankrupt your crew from spinning the Wheel of Fortune black
We take you there and send you walking back!

[Chorus: Substantial and Pase Rock]
Substan, blessing it; yes, I am, blessing it
UV for life Hell yes, we stay blessing it
Pase, I'm blessing it; Yes, I stay blessing it
Five Deez forever, you know we stay blessing it
Substan, blessing it; yes, I am, blessing it
UV for life Hell yes, we stay blessing it
Pase, I'm blessing it; Yes, I stay blessing it
Five Deez forever, you know we stay blessing it"

""I've been so free, I've been so free here

But I haven't selected exactly something quartet

""John, which kinda players do you think have influenced you, if any at all?""

[Instrumental]"
Metaphorical Music,,male,Lady Brown (Ft. Cise Star),"[Verse 1: Cise Starr]
Crush a coal to a diamond, eyes forever shining
Your beauty alone inspire a nigga to rhyming
Thinking of the better things in life
Thinking of how I could persuade you to become my wife
Hand in hand as we floating over tropical sands
You my lady, I'm your man, so let's further advance
To the next scene, me sleeping next to you, resting (Haha)
You're the personification of all God's blessings
Coming to me in just one physical being (Yeah)
One physical dream that I wanna redeem
You're voluptuous, sweet, caramel-brown, honeydew
Satin skin smooth to the touch, what a nigga do?
So sensual, her smile like a chemical
Extract of perfection, rare mineral
She smell like a happy birthday on a Thursday
Quiet time love, sleep in, I'll wake early

[Chorus: Cise Starr]
Honey brown with the long, black hair
Teasing me with a kiss and a stare
Slight touch and you're taking me there
So fine and it just ain't fair
So beautiful and so damn rare

[Verse 2: Cise Starr]
She's angelic and energetic, using sex as a weapon
I reckon that I'm confessing her body is just a blessing
From God down to Earth, she needs to be in a church
To prove we didn't spawn from fish, but God's work
Hurts to see her clothed 'cause her body beholds
Secrets untold, valued like platinum and gold
For she is the key to open my mind to see
The energy that radiates from the gates of heavenly
Bliss, I reminisce over touch and a kiss
While you fucking a bitch, I go to make love to my miss
Never scandalous, it's unanimous that the hue will handle it
Lights off and candle-lit rooms are glamorous
Yo, I'll call you love, sexual, you look edible
Parallel, snuggle up close, intellectual
In a rendezvous, push you a rap hairdo
No makeup, in jean shorts, open-toed shoe
I want to hold you, mold your soul, I'll behold you
Know you better than myself, never own you
But keep you, never leave you, I'll beseech you
God's gift to man is you wearing a see-through
Riding Sea-Doos in Atlantic Ocean, causing commotion
Lay you down, going through the motions
Keep your skin soft, lotions got me coasting
Down, pretty, round, brown, thighs, the candles low-lit

[Chorus: Cise Starr]
Honey brown with the long, black hair
Teasing me with a kiss and a stare
Slight touch and you're taking me there
So fine and it just ain't fair
So beautiful and so damn rare

[Verse 3: Cise Starr]
Look at this agreeable, delightful, delectable
Unforgettable, so sweet she may be edible
She needs a pedestal to step out of heaven—you ready, boo?
Never hypothetical, you factual and magical
Fuck theatrical, baby girl, because you actual
Physically, your chemistry is so mathematical
Had to use academics to define your spirit
You lifting my limits, your name off of my tongue is a lyric
She's a compilation of my mind's representation
Of a representative representing an excellent revelation
Of time and dedication (She will), never impatient (For real)
She know the deal, (Reveal) herself to me
So I can see her heavenly ways, her heavenly gaze
And, plus, it don't hurt that she has an ass for days (Okay)
So as we lay, I reminisce on the day that we met
Please, God, never let me forget..."
Metaphorical Music,,male,Kumomi,This song is an instrumental
Metaphorical Music,,male,Highs 2 Lows (Ft. Cise Star),"[Verse 1]
Individual stars float in an ocean of God
Rocking a pinky ring of Saturn while I'm visiting Mars
Egos bigger than Jupiter are breaking the bars
Holding me back down to Earth through physical laws
Touching the moon, grace as I ready resume
Comets flying through space, bringing possible doom
Blocking the Sun, bring a holocaust on the world
I'm talking back to Father Time, Mother Earth is my girl
I got the wings of angels walking down the valley of death
Watching my step ‘cause The Devil's never one to respect
Come correct on the studio track, taking it back
To the pen and pad, I blast the original rap
Brother on the b-boy tip
With Krylon spit, I tag the charts with the graphical hits
So who you fucking with? Arm, leg, leg to arm, head
Snapping your neck back while you spit out a Pez
I be the original son of a bitch, hurting your wrist
‘Cause you spinning my shit so much the needle skip
Flip to the rhythm and reminisce
Remember the days of '94—hip hop was a gift (OK)
Words out of her lips came straight from the heart
Never prepackaged or bought for negative thought
Peddled to consumers, magazines, and rumors
Commercial spots turn real artists to looters
Precise rap, rock and roll; Nigga, let’s do this
I'll float through notes, break beats with my maneuvers


[Chorus]
Yo, regardless, while I be moving swiftly through darkness
Plotting, charting my path, I'm running, cutting my losses
Stumbling over unknown bumps and complications
And tribulations of my life of revelations
Yo, regardless, while I be moving swiftly through darkness
Plotting, charting my path, I'm running, cutting my losses
Stumbling over unknown bumps and complications
And tribulations of my life of revelations

[Verse 2]
Speaking to Scorpius making my heart turn to porcelain
It used to have a steady beat, now it’s easily broken
Mind coasting, train of thought stopped emotions
Welling at the core of my being, causing commotion
Need to release ‘cause the stress’ll tear me to pieces
My love ceases and my thoughts break into leases
The height of my life, but the strife making me leave this
I can't beat this, going to God to defeat this
Will He help or do I have to do this myself?
Alone and confused, the blues burden my health
My eyes remain closed ‘cause my highs are lows
I'm feeling the blows of rain ‘cause my pain is cold
Now who am I? A man, or pawn in life?
Living day to day, I pray—am I wrong or right?
Losing my mind, so maybe you can help me find
The way to go so I can be leaving this pain behind
Trying to sleep; ""Sleep is the cousin of death""
Said a wise man from Queensbridge on beats he blessed (Yeah)
Trying to rest, instead, I rest my head
On a pillow of hardships, misery is the bed
On my back, I lie. I can see the skies
Through the glass ceiling, the reason tears drowning my eyes
And I can't move; grief won't let me think
My soul is dry, I crawl just to take a drink
I made you blink, think like invisible man
With mechanical hands, trying to reach out to my fans


[Chorus]
Yo, regardless, while I be moving swiftly through darkness
Plotting, charting my path, I'm running, cutting my losses
Stumbling over unknown bumps and complications
And tribulations of my life of revelations
Yo, regardless, while I be moving swiftly through darkness
Plotting, charting my path, I'm running, cutting my losses
Stumbling over unknown bumps and complications
And tribulations of my life of revelations

[Verse 3]
Yo, viscosity of the hidden meaning between my words
Thicken the plot—I got hidden rhythms and verse
I'm loading a hearse, you biting like a Dracula curse
I'm bringing the worst of hurt like a sermon in church
Pertaining to you, hurts just to listen to truth
So you'd rather listen to lies, so you're living to lose
I'm beginning to win, young man mastering sin
Battle within, looking at The Devil and grin
I'm flipping the script, walking on a journey and trip
On the gurney and missed at the fact that life is a bitch
And I'm hating this shit, losing blood, making me Crip
The stakes is high—bet and I lost the grip
Searching for bliss with the razor over my wrist
Needing a job, but the drug test's checking my piss
I'm looking through a window and seeing Immaculate Conception
Reborn, piercing my core with seven swords
A knight in a war, looking to the eyes of the lord
Calculating, want more, seeing the signs of heaven nevermore
The last matador riding a pale horse
Losing my course, splitting the hairs, causing divorce
Marriage unborn, I havoc in song, I stumbled upon
Lost jewels of thought thought to be gone
Lost forever, I sever motherfuckers with letters
Written in script, forward to the rap that I rip
From the top of the lip, make a drink, taking a sip
Then I'm gulping the shit, falling deeper in the abyss"

The jiggy vines, the sugar dimes

Now pop the cork and steam the Vega and get lit
What, what, what

[Verse 1: Geechi Suede]
Introducing phantom of the dark, walk through my heaven
With levitation from reefers, drenching divas in E7
Showboating with Rugers, flash vines, Belafonte vigor
Let's skate for what this worth as we confiscate your figures

[Verse 2: Sonny Cheeba]
Casanova Brown levitating jiggy in dashikis
A la hotta car, fifty-four, chasing diamond runners
Headed ice bound, the big chilla diamond convention
Harlem Buck Strut, freezing world heist, Hollywood
Madame Butterfly, let me in your house of pleasure
From the knuckle Swatch, shadowboxers catching black-eyed blues

[Verse 3: Geechi Suede]
I play the deef, what
Sensations at the Mardi Gras be screaming Chee-ba
Fulfilling pleasures in my castles, blow the smoke out
The Garcia Vega substitutes when the Dutch is gone
The Lo don't stop, give me shouts
It's the seasoned sautéers, souffléers for swerving on corners
We magnets to moolah, living with Charlie's Angels on us
No smiling we're sliding, that gets you caught up in the octa
Or deaded for moving, it's just like that as we proceed


[Verse 4: Sonny Cheeba]
Saturday night special better take it light, you Jah Jah
You're a Capitan, quest to the coast of Key Largo

And we hailing from the Magic City
Transcending Suede-a on your aura
Found 'chini in London, relaxation in Bora Bora
Got notion to bring it, sing it, never been my function

Get it, got it, the Lo will forever be nice and

We start the Harlem River Quiver, dig it sweet daddy
Sharpen the crimson blade, High Sierra serenade
Anatomy for seduction be this ebony junction

[Verse 8: Geechi Suede]
As we exit the place with grace
Drizzy Amaret-tah, the bursting of clouds, it pours

Now who got what you don't got, Lo do, next verse

On some Suede shit, and my ambiance be on some far
Don't you reach kid, you can get vamoose, what's the use?

[Verse 2: Sonny Cheeba]
Well we welling down the whiskey, Cheeba reach the rainbow drive
Towards the Bermuda Triangle with my high
Enter the rocket, foul, friend of the cris-tal
In the Blue Oyster, shooting Zorro to get paid
Fade into the shade, fine moonshine and wine
Now dig what I say 'uh', make me say it one more time
Himalaya playmaker, stashing goods and get the stepping
Seven minutes in heaven, so I gleam the Lena Horne

[Verse 3: Geechie Suede]
The Suede and Cheeba will prevail, sail Indian skies
My display of Belafonte, ice, cheeky, it's fly
Got the ravishing ruger, waiver on deck, my sea port
In the regional hydro-park, post card, and get praised
Hottest M.C.'s, blazing the hemp, limp crystal cool
In another millenium blow the dust off these jewels

[Verse 4: Sonny Cheeba]
Peep the due, laddie, I blow, operation, pacific
If they want it, I kick it all the way to Wakiki
Iron curtain, certain I pull a stocking and skirt-and
Fa-la-la-la, they run, and chill is chiller
Dynamo Duo burnt it, at the Bokeemi heat stroke
Yes Sonny Cheeba with the Satin Struthers make up
Yo G. Suede!

How we gonna do it? one time y'all
Boogie to the left and to the right y'all

Now it's Bye-ya, heat drop from the cah-cah phase
Practice yoga, freezing out, spraying Afro-sheen

[Verse 6: Geechie Suede]
The Lo shit be that jiggy shit, Jah, get your wages up
Lebanon, off the Henny-Dom, higher horizons
Flagrant, silky step toes don't touch the pavement
Just toss Ice and Bricks, skimmer slick, ace, duece, tray shit
My binocular occupy the ocean, off the octagon
The ooohs! and onyx through the opal, Villa Valore
Spilling New Score, the green leaf on it, I pour the meeble
On the fraudulent and galavant, in the Mercury Segal

[Verse 7: Sonny Cheeba]
Call you Sarafina, I throw my thumbalina, up in Dairy Queen 'uh'
Seen her, up in the Beamer with the jiggy fox
Sonny Cheeba, cashmere, no go back to your apple jack
With no finesse in distress
And a full confession, on how you messing, getting funkin' lessons
From the Doctor, Strange love, effervescence
See the star and crescents, when I open up that ass
She's in wonderland, and we do electric bugaloos


[Verse 8: Geechie Suede]
Now we here at the frontier, by Suede, vintage out
Cover my square, re-assemble my crooks for assembly
Make note of my mark, east-trace, slice and brace ox
All flam and flamboyant, meet me crossroads, one way zones
If you with it, I'm with it, blow my smoke, claustrophobic
You can get dealt with, on these flats and you know it
Come on!

I say, Rickety Rocket was my favorite cartoon
And after marriage comes the honeymoon
Who love Popeye, is Alice the Goon?
Ate the Honeycomb cereal with my big spoon
Woke up so late it was half past noon
Had to gather my connections and form a platoon
Niggas don't see it, but the war come soon
Got the Ummah, got the remedy, so son, stay tuned
And if I had a month to pick, it'd be June
I get up in your hide like Daniel Boone

I just finished heat in the mercury
But he was screechin'
My aim wasn't accurate, off two degrees
Bubbly, ? the toast
Skatin' on ice slippery
Smothered in Absolut
Was you drink
Absolutely
Motion melodic, I got it
Carvin' the suede parader
With crooks that retrieve diamonds
My high velocity fades
My intention to dock them
Leave them with Sonny Cheeba
Flamin' off vodka
In the submarine
Landscape in the next ?

Listen to this super fly
Bumpin' Black Caesar on high
Meltin' inside my ? fi
Tuned to the Black Belt Jones

Let me in that centerfold
Sugar smokin' Sonny Cheeba
Name Cheeba baby Shane
Listen to my game of death
Sugar shackin' right to left
Shappin' in a fly trap
And your lady Scarface hand over that merchandise
Nice ice

Killin' 'em softly, makin' them cop bleed
Blessin' the black leaf, stick 'em with 40E's
Killin' 'em softly, makin' them cop bleed
Blessin' the black leaf, stick 'em with 40E's

Now I got crystals, bruh
Cola browsin' Blackula
If cubic zirconium convince the test, then bash this
Money on the wood make the bettin' good
Sista, girl, or madams
Zenobia is runnin' all them broads and chicks
While she directin' flicks
Whistlin' the henchmen
Yes, I got a few of these cats
Got them on drink(?) crouchin'
Don't they know I'm diamond crook
Satin Struthers production
Now you go by my shit
And try to screw the ?

Up in Esso's with espressos
Reflectin' ice
Familiar face, about to get stone era for his life
But not in the sight
Prefer to play the shade, the afterhours
Besides, Meenie Shimes is taking Henny don showers
So I bless another glass, pass the link to Joe Chink
Don't talk, don't think
Just start the flashin' and make a cinema
Limited choices, her voice is comin' from the rear
Put those in my campus
I'm gonna see 'em again

Ain't no motions without my baby
Quicksilver, yeah, that's my lady
Before this holocaust on the concourse
Thought ""time a late tree""
In the Vega sensations
Seductive, I let my guard down
Blindfolded by the reefers in the back of my building, uptown
Run yours, I paused, turnt around, two deep the laze
God bless my twin soul, Sonny Cheeba to save the day


[Verse 6: Sonny Cheeba]
Got to set 'em free
One more time, touch em from behind
And then miss a play
Tryin' to three out
Geechi Suede
Now to levitate
Right inside the outlaws paradise
Never blinkin' twice
Just to the fellas how it is

[Verse 7: G-Suede]
Yeah, how it is is how it was
Cousin, listen and know the rules
The connection of Suede and Cheeba
Karachi blazin' fat ?
In that igloo, coolin' the coolest ones
And never clashes
Sprinke my ashes
Diamond crooks and we Cassius

[Outro: Sonny Cheeba]
Yo bruh, fuck that dude
Definitely set that cat free, bruh

Come here, girl
Oh, you want me to touch you right there?
Oh, like a little lamb, play in your hair
Oh you want it? Oh you want it right now
Like that? I got you baby
All on you baby
Push it back on daddy
Push it back on daddy baby

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
I seen it vividly jogging my brain memory, life is...
I seen it vividly jogging my brain memory
Life no longer infinity this was the final calling
No birds chirping or flying, no dogs barking
We all nervous and crying, moving in caution
In disbeliefs our belief's the reason for all this
The tallest building plummet, cracking, and crumbling
The ground is shaking, swallowing young woman
With a baby, daisies, and other flowers burning in destruction
The smell is disgusting, the heat is unbearable
Preachers touching on boys run for cover, the paranoid
Rapists and murderers hurdle alleys
Valleys and high places turn into dust
Famous screaming in agony
Atheists for suicide, planes falling out the sky
Trains jumping off the track, mothers yelling ""he's alive""
Backpedaling Christians settling for forgiveness
Evidence all around us the town is covered in fishes
Ocean water dried out, fire burning more tides out
Tabernacle and city capital turned inside out
Public bathroom, college classroom's been deserted
Another trumpet has sounded off and everyone heard it
(It's happening) no more running from world wars
(It's happening) no more discriminating the poor
(It's happening) no more bad bitches and real niggas
Wishing for green and gold the last taste of allure
I swore I seen it vividly
A moniker of war from heaven that play the symphony
Thunder like number four, then I heard
""What have you did for me""
I fell to my knees, pulled out my resume
That dated back to June 17th, 1987
My paperwork was like a receipt
I was valedictorian, I was fearful of judgment
But confident I had glory in all my past endeavors
Close my eyes, pray to God that I live forever
Dark skies, fire and brimstone, some of us sent home
Some of us never did wrong but still went to hell
Geez Louise, I thought you said that I excel
I made To Pimp a Butterfly for you
Told me to use my vocals to save mankind for you
Say I didn't try for you, say I didn't ride for you
I tithed for you, I pushed the club to the side for you
Who love you like I love you?
Crucifix, tell me you can fix
Anytime I need, I'ma start jotting everything in my diary
Never would you lie to me
Always camaraderie, I can see, our days been numbered
Revelation greatest as we hearing the last trumpet
All man, child, woman, life completely went in reverse
I guess I'm running in place trying to make it to church


[Outro]
Young nigga act an ass
Young nigga act a fool
Young nigga get yo' cash

All morning with the mixed dashboards, triple digits
Parallel park like an alien came visit
Slideshow for the night show, ten bitches
Find hoes with a blindfold, King Kendrick

So many plays, homie, I finesse
Palisade views with some sex
I lost a lot of love for missionary
This the first time I confess
Me and Top is like a Kobe and Phil
A father figure fuck with him, you get killed
Fuck with me and he will kill you himself
TDE the mafia of the west
Move in silence, yeah, we juggin’ like that
Act of violence, yeah, we juggin’ like that
I did a lot of dumb shit in my past
Lord forgive me, hoping I don't relapse
Dave just bought a new 911
Almost thought I’d seen another plane crash
Q just bought a brand new McLaren
Rock-a-lack about to buy the projects
Moosa got his son dripping in gold
Ali 'bout to let his hair down on hoes
Me, I'm 'bout to let my hair down on hoes
Top billin', that’s a million a show
Might blow the whole no whammy on Soul
Might tell Obama be more like Punch
Sounwave caught a Grammy last year
Mack wop, bet he do what he want
Fuck you niggas, level two, I'm not done
2Teez told me that I'm the one
I can put a rapper on life support
Guarantee that's something none of you want
Ten homies down and they all serving life
What is like twenty-five hundred a month?
What if I empty my bank out and stunt?
What if I certified all of these ones?
Bitch, I get buck, I'm as real as they come
Shit is amazing, I'm feeding my cravings
You know that you want me, come here now, lil' baby

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar & Mani Strings]
(What did the Asian say?) ""A peace of mind""
That's what the Asian said—I need a divine
Intervention was his religion and I was surprised
Him believing in Buddha, me believing in God
Asked him what are you doing, he said ""taking my time""
Meditation is a must, it don't hurt if you try
See you thinking too much, plus you too full of yourself
Worried about your career, you ever think of your health?

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar & Mani Strings]
(What did the Indian say?) ""A piece of land""
That's what the Indian said—I needed the man
Telling me longevity is in the dirt
Should buy some property first
Should profit a better dollar with generational perks
Equity at his best, really, you should invest
These tangible things expire, don't you expect
Income with so much outcome and yes
Look at my heritage, we blessed

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & Mani Strings]
(Now, what the black man say?) ""A piece of pussy""
That's what the black man said I needed to push me
To the limit, to satisfy my hunger
We do it all for a woman from haircut to a war
We like to live in the jungle, like to play in the peach
What you saying to me?
He said ""nigga, come back to reality for a week""
Pussy is power, fuck on a new bitch every night
I wouldn't be prouder, you should allow it


[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar & Mani Strings]
(What the white man say?) A piece of mine's
That's what the white man wanted when I rhyme
Telling me that he selling me just for $10.99
If I go platinum from rapping, I do the company fine
What if I compromise? He said it don't even matter
You make a million or more, you living better than average
You losing your core following, gaining it all
He put a price on my talent, I hit the bank and withdraw
Hit the bank and withdraw, hit the bank and withdraw
Put myself in the rocket ship and I shot for the stars
""Look at what you accomplishing""; what he said to the boy
""I'ma make you some promises that you just can't ignore
Your profession anonymous as an artist if I don't target your market
If you ain't signing your signature when I throw you my wallet
A lot of rappers are giving their demo all in the toilet
Your world tour, your master's, mortgage, I need a piece""

Somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor
Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal
Drowned inside the lake outside, away you flow
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me
Somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor
Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal
Drowned inside the lake outside, away you flow
And this I know

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I got 100 on my dash, got 200 in my drum
Name in the grab bags, put my Bible in the trunk
Taaka vodka on the top of my binocular, I'm drunk
How come I can make them popular, pop em' when I want
See I'm livin' with anxiety, duckin' the sobriety
Fuckin' up the system, I ain't fuckin' with society
Justice ain't free, therefore justice ain't me
So I justify his name on obituary
Why you wanna see a good man with a broken heart?
Once upon a time I used to go to church and talk to God
Now I'm thinkin' to myself, hollow tips is all I got
Now I'm drinkin' by myself, at the intersection, parked
Watch you when you walk inside your house
You threw your briefcase all on the couch
I plan on creeping through your fuckin' door and blowin' out
Every piece of your brain until your son jump in your arms
Cut on the engine, then sped off in the rain, I'm gone

Lit off Henny, I'm tryna dismantle
These wicked ways, I've engaged in such a gamble
'Cause I could speak the truth and I know the world would unravel, wait
That's a bit ambitious maybe I'm trippin'
Maybe I'm crazy, maybe I exist in a different dimension
Not to mention when I close my eyes I see the distance
It's such a scary sight so I rarely go to sleep at night
I watch the sun rise then I watch the sun fall
Studied the son of God and still don't recognize my flaws
I guess I'm lost, the cost of being successful is equal to being neglectful
I pray my experience helps you
As for me I'm tryna sort it out
Searching for loopholes in my bruised soul
But who knows?
I just need a little space to breathe
I know perception is key, so I am king


[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & Jay Rock]
The other side has never mortified my mortal mind
The borderline between insanity is Father Time
I fall behind my skeleton, they tell me that I'm blind
I know that I'm intelligent, my confidence just died
Carpe diem, seize the day, I can't compromise
A tapeworm couldn't cure this gluttonous appetite
A couple trinkets, they seein' me as I pacify
But couldn't fathom the meaning of seein' sacrifice
I'm passin' lives on the daily, maybe I'm losing faith
Genocism and capitalism just made me hate
Correctionals and these private prisons gave me a date
Professional dream killers reason why I'm awake
I'm sleepwalkin', I'm street stalkin', I'm outta place
Reinforcing this heat barking, these are the brakes
Before I blink, do I see me before them pearly gates?

Of rhymes that are built like a chariot
Dope vocals carry it to the battle set

But now I must bow to the crowd as I stand proud

'Cause battles and wars and much fights I have been through
One MC got beheaded, and you can too
Forget it, 'cause you'd rather be just a spectator
An onlooker, afraid you may get slayed
Or struck by a blow from a mic gladiator
I betcha that later you might be sad that you played yourself
'Cause you stepped up, chest puffed out
And in just one lyric, you got snuffed out

Never choosin' to lose my spot, not once

You better sit again, citizen; weak MC's, I get rid of them

Don't be too eager when you're seeking a break
'Cause chumps will exploit, use you to benefit
So just be keen and learn all the ins of it

I left them squealing, ""It was I who did the taking""
Proceeding exactly, according to plan
I foiled the scheme 'cause it seemed I was that man

My conscience says it's nonsense, if I put up with it
It meaning sleazy, sorry-type slick types
I'll drive 'em all to danger, and make 'em hitchike

Set your mind free as I slam these thoughts
And just like a jammy goes bow
You're gonna see what I'm sayin' now
You can't be sleepin', 'cause things are gettin' crazy
You better stop being lazy
There's many people frontin', and many brothers droppin'
All because of dumb things, let me tell you somethin'
I've been through so much that I'm such
A maniac, but I still act out of faith
That we can get the shit together so I break
On fools with no rhymes skills messin' up the flow
And people with no sense who be movin' much too slow
And so, you will know the meaning of the Gang Starr
Guru with the mic and Premier raise the anchor
Swiftly, as we embark on a journey
I had to get an attorney
I needed someone to defend my position
Decisions I made, 'cause now it's time to get paid
And ladies, these rhymes are like the keys to a dope car
Maybe a Lexus or a Jaguar
Still, all of that is just material
So won't you dig the scenario
And just imagine if each one is teachin' one
We'll come together so that we become
A strong force, then we can stay on course
Find your direction through introspection
And for my people out there I got a question
Can we be the sole controllers of our fate?
Now who's gonna take the weight?



[Hook: Cuts by DJ Premier]
You can't handle the whole weight

[Verse 2]
The weight of the world is heavy on my mind
So as my feelings unwind I find
That some try to be down just 'cause it's trendy
Others fall victim to envy
But I'll take the road less traveled
So I can see all my hopes and my dreams unravel
Relievin' your stress, expressin' my interest
In the situation that you're facin'
That's why I'm down with the Nation
Spirituality supports reality
We gotta fight with the right mentality
So we can gain what is rightfully ours
This is the meaning of the chain and the star
Land is power, so gimme forty acres
Let's see how far I can take ya
Original invincible, that's how I'm lookin' at it
I use my rhymes like a Glock automatic
Any means necessary, I'm goin' all out
Before the rains bring the nuclear fallout
So let me ask you, is it too late?
Ayo, who's gonna take the weight?

Now here is all these peoples (right)
Who are moved here...thirty, forty years- fifty years ago (to the promised land)
And whatever they were moved here by is no longer there
I see- 'cause now I look on the street every day and I see all these young men standing on the corner
It used to be you could drop out, even [?] daughter
You could drop out of high school and you could always get you [?] that Ford (mhm)
You know, in the factory (right)
And then you- you didn't have to stand on the corner (right)
'Cause you're...eighth-grade kid, you...as long as he could pick up something, he had a job (mhm)
And that was white or black (mhm)
Nowadays, there's no place to do but stand on the corner

[Chorus: Boldy James]
ConCreatures, 100cc's for the shooters
This is every dope fiend's dream that's a tuner
Therapeutic to the user, the heroin abusers
Know I'm a ConCreature like I'm starin' at Medusa, it's

What up, bro?
Yo, where the fuck you at, man? What the fuck you doin', dog? Missin' all type of cheese out here, man. Like, we out here gettin' it, man, you in th- you missin' in action, dog! What the fuck goin' on with you, man?
Let me tell you, man, look...


[Verse]
Now my lady on my case, so I'm fillin' out an app
All I know is how to whip dust in a Pyrex
Got a baby on the way, damn it's a mess
""Have you ever been convicted of a felony?""
Yes? Check in the box to the left, say ""No""
Fresh out the box with a fresh new caseload
Step out the box for a sec, think, Bold
They ain't tryna hire you with jailhouse tattoos
On your left forearm, starin', lookin' at you
Like you up to no good, scared and afraid to
Look you in your eye like a man when he face you
Still got a phone in his hand, and it dead, tell you
""Give me a call"" if anything was available
Didn't get the job, now the rent and the cable due
End of the month, with the gas and the AOL
First of the month, fiends cashin' their welfare
Checks, on the third, I'll be lampin' on Lamphere
Standin' on the curb just sellin' cocaine
With some very close friends that'll catch you long-range
And dig in your nerves, you can tell it, on James
I still got the work and I'm sellin' whole thangs
Got pills for dessert, heroin for dope fiends
Who flick, burn, and set it on flame
And then insert it in their varicose veins


[Chorus]
ConCreatures, 100cc's for the shooters
This is every dope fiend's dream that's a tuner
Therapeutic to the user, the heroin abusers
Know I'm a ConCreature like I'm starin' at Medusa

This is every dope fiend's dream that's a tuner

You get a reward for any info that you give, it's been sworn to secrecy
Once you snitch and inform them agencies, trust ain't a issue no more, basically
'Specially with me, I can't fuck with you snitches, dawg

Storm from the bottom of sieta
To the top of Six Mile, all my credits is cut
Sharpenin' ice picks in prison
Plus I'm harder than a lifer that's bitten it
Eye on your penitent purgatory, on a up north trip, the judge signin' permission slips
Hit the Mary J. Blige and reminisce about the Section 8 housin' and cribs for rent
We was selling weight out of it with pistol grips
Even when your neighbors was out of it, we kept the shit
So when they say it's a drought comin', I don't trip
I just wait and I rob niggas who holding

Overstepped his boundaries and wasn't (welcome to 76)

You gotta be built for this
Born alone, die alone, you can't count on nobody but yourself
You're all you got out here, man
What proffered a man to gain the whole world?
It don't have control on his soul! Oh, God
You want to change from the way you've been livin'
It hasn't been easy for you
Prepare us, prepare us to walk the streets of Detroit
We don't need to go no place else
Oh, we can see you with the pots that ain't never seen the stove

[Chorus]
If I don't scale this boat? If I sit on my bag
Then I'ma be flat broke
So I sit on my ass if I can get cashflow
So I be 'bout my bread, watchin' for task force
And SWAT on my Launchpad

[Verse 1]
And I'm back for more, Detroit's ambassador
Chancellor of the Ambassador Bridge
To Canada, in the back of that rig
Was some dust, cancerous enough to get us maximum bids
Lookin' at addin' a brig
I'm never satisfied, like my mammy, she said
""Jay, babe, just like your father, bold and cold""
It's Detroit, Michigan in December, sold my soul to the concrete
Devil in the blue dress got me doin' life in the ghetto so the music
That I write is for the ghetto-ous hoodlums
Tryna make a way out of no way
Down with heavyweight, tre four-way, John C. James' cousin
I pack pistols on that block boy tip
Boldy McNichols on some Lodge boy shit
Six Mile, Brick Mile, Southfield Freeway
I'm in that brick house on Archdale and PA
Across the street from that church
Across the street from where my work is
What do this cross mean on my Turkish? (link)
Why do I talk street with a slur?
Is it 'cause I'm from Detroit? Where you don't eat, you don't work
Got the fiends' mouths waterin' for a piece of dessert (crack)
Beggin', ""let me get a taste"", you don't eat 'fore my thirst
Get quenched, 'til I clench tender, legal reserve (money)
Federal commissary notes (cheese)
Man, I'm tellin' you, I'm tired of sellin' dope
'Cause ain't shit worse than when you gotta sell this dope (dope)
Gotta tote this mag (gah!)


[Chorus]
If I don't scale this boat?
If I sit on my bag
Then I'ma be flat broke
So I sit on my ass
If I can get cashflow
So I be 'bout my bread
Watchin' for task force and SWAT on my Launchpad

[Verse 2]
'Cause I done got cash on all the blocks on the westside
Stood on every slab, caught a hot one and didn't die
Witnessed my mans get shot dead, and didn't cry (nah)
Seen my folk get murdered, I was just eleven
They say it only get worse 'fore it get better
I pray it don't get worster than it been lately (no)
If it get any worse, dude, what's worse than crazy? (what?)
Besides pistols when they shootin'
My street shit'll clink me in a mental institution
Been thinkin' how I think, man, I think I'm finna to lose it
Reachin' for my piece when I feel the slightest movements (SK)
Or hear the slightest noise (brr)
I'm off a Skittle and I'm 'noided
They got me 'noid but I ain't paranoid
Always feelin' like I'm bein' watched, paranoid
I can't sleep, I'm in the dope game, Nina Ross
Me and my girlfriend
I think these niggas and these bitches out to get me
Rise and fly, wanna leave me hangin' out to dry
Set me up for failure, just to let me down and die
When they need to dig deep down inside themselves, to find themselves
Instead of always tryna lose their lives, I read y'all
Negativity is what I feed off (sucka)
And relatively speaking, I think y'all niggas is a bunch of egotistical fake thugs with foolish pride
On McNichols, we crave blood
Can you rely on them goons that's with you? (no)
'Cause you and I, we can use them pistols
Will you survive? 'Cause I do's this shit, dude
You a lie, and the truth ain't in you
Get crucified, I'll shoot him and you
Mummify you like Snoop and Chris do

Let's ride, 'til the gas on E

'Til it putt-putt, stall out, transmission leak
'Til the tie rods pop off and the engine block steams
Somebody gotta die, 'til I'm captured I'ma prey
On your mommy and your pa, tell him ""Happy Father's Day""
Tell him ""Happy Kwanzaa"", tell her ""Happy Mother's Day""
Tell her ""Happy Hanukkah"" before I blow your fuckin' brains
In the middle of next month, I'm going through a thing

[Verse 1]
I just lost my two twins in an accident
Would've been my firstborn kids, guess it wasn't meant
It's been a series of unfortunate events
And I'm gettin' real leery of whom I call my friends
Them didn't help when I need a helping hand
Only one that sent me mail when I was locked up was Danielle
Elizabeth Merriweather in my jail cell
Them letters held a nigga down like an anvil
In that time capsule where time stands still
Like you runnin' laps for practice on the treadmill
Better beware of what comes with all that transactin'
Just take care of my moms if somethin' bad happens
Tell Arielle Marie Jones to tell my dad that I
Want to let it be known that I ain't mad at him
Taught me to stand on my own two, I'm bad mannered
With bad habits, gon' smoke until I catch cancer
Curse of me, but most importantly
He taught me how to laugh in the face of adversity
And how to be a man, I thank you for learning me
Now I truly understand what ""patience is a virtue"" means



[Chorus]
Somebody gotta die, 'til I'm captured I'ma prey
On your mommy and your pa, tell him ""Happy Father's Day""
Tell him ""Happy Kwanzaa"", tell her ""Happy Mother's Day""
Tell her ""Happy Hanukkah"" before I blow your fuckin' brains

[Verse 2]
Fully in my hand, burstin' flames
Bullets flyin' everywhere, that's the thing about this dirty game
It never fails, the big house or an early grave
Dead or in jail, use your blinker in the turning lane
And let's ride, 'til the gas on E
Tires go bald, and they need some brand new me
'Til it putt-putt, stall out, transmission leak
'Til the tie rods pop off and the engine block steams
Somebody gotta die
Hearin' rumors they gon' take out and murder James
You get respect when you lay down your murder game
I laid my game down flat as a vertebrae
You gave your man to the feds over thirty days?
[?] turns to eternity
They say they down, then turn they backs, and turn on me
Then turn around in my state of emergency (snakes)
They turn me down, need a favor, then turn to me (fuck outta here)
In their time of dire need with the urgency
But they ain't nowhere to be found and it's irkin' me


[Chorus]
Somebody gotta die, 'til I'm captured I'ma prey
On your mommy and your pa, tell him ""Happy Father's Day""
Tell him ""Happy Kwanzaa"", tell her ""Happy Mother's Day""
Tell her ""Happy Hanukkah"" before I blow your fuckin' brains

Since the love between us no longer exists
And each time that darkness falls, it finds me alone

Make a nigga flaunt his stripes like Barbasol
Hard to call, it sound like rapping
This the art of falling, down
Covering ground as well
Violence is the groove, pan-frying breadfruit
He said silence is the move and we got noisy
Your favorite rapper soundtrack the daily stockholming
There go that plot roaming
Rates apply, epicanthic eye fold, accept the charges
Brace for life's barrages, cohens, and eavesdroppers
Plea coppers and bargain hunters
Marginalia conductor, alien other
Outside in the outside, her mouth wider
Need more air to stoke this great fire
Slow farming my necessities, ancient recipes
Move with ease and grace
What's modern is plagued with hesitancy
Lag interruptions, you need time to process instruction

And you know the self is defined by the struggling
It's true
You know the self is defined by the struggling
Found pain in the, found the
Found the pain quite, quite, quite humbling
You know the self is defined by the struggling

Dare to peek through the viewfinder
Up close with a rude reminder
Deuteronomy in E minor
Shuffling chicken bones
Searchin' for hidden tones and meanings
Niggas was triangulatin' the feelin'
Hidden motives turn to rigor mortis
With rigid hortense, vivid reminders of why I don't like surprises
Behind the curtain like Polonius
Screams of pain and they hittin' most melodius
Tell yourself that ain't odious, ock, it's only obvious
It's bogus whoadie, I'm Bodie Broadus singin' spo-dee-o-dee
With the loaded pop, and that's a metaphor, really
You know the vagabond drifty, troubadour shifty
Like the two things shifted, perspective be infinite
Perpetually lifted, the most high gifts abundant
Soulfolks glow illustrious
You move too slow to fuck wit' us
Feelin' lucid in the foreign model
Two scoops in my affogato

The best apprentices are a tad hesitant, teachers too
Most people try to delete their blues, and with it most of life
But, those are dirty thoughts on such a gorgeous night
This beat sound like a long walk to the dumpster
Funk like nostrils of muenster, made myself an apostle of wonder
I want to behold magnificence, I want to behold magnificence

The seed sprouted and we shouted way past rooftops
Walk across, indeed, poppin' bottles off
The sprout grew to sappling eye, that's what's happening
Lost in shade, then umber, the way to the under
The permanent other bardmen
Dreams are nursed in darkness and there's no parking, on foot
Preaching the rhyming word is absurdist
Pledging allegiance before reading the terms of service agreement
No antecedent, order the ancestor moth meetin'
And tonight I'm holding court with my heathens
A staff made of Pringles, beard lookin' wizardly
I remember it vividly, send the enemy my utmost sympathies
Ruby yacht, we scream it diligently, pillage differently
On a teeter totter with lasers lurks milky moon
Word to Skipp Coon
I never needed freedom papers
I never needed freedom papers
Gimme space to wave my arms around
Sword have you in the mood to put your armor down
It's the gumption of the gumshoe
Living room Kung Fu, you gon' have to catch me first
My net worth is not material
This day began with flax milk and cereal
Prolly end with rice and beans
Fuck wealth and the hype machine
Rather have health and an icy spring, or electrician training
I can hear a rapper hesitating, but that won't pay this car note, will it?
Out the barrel into the skillet, out the barrel into the skillet
And the whole time I was screamin'"

One fell stroke, no Gödel code with the L in the hell hole

Yesterday I had a fight in a nightclub
But I had my gat and I bust alive
Ran a man hand them up in the air
And prepare to run for cover, but then I must survive
I hop on the back of the wack stuff 105
I thought about wacky jackie [?] that died
But I replied rely
That he is a black man he must survive
I went to the Good Life hip hop got live?
On deck for the Freestyle Fellowship tribe
So pack a tape, he peeled off a five
I got stucky wet em up what connived?
He ran of with the tapey and the money in the jar
But what was wack was what he contrived
He try to bite the wheety, but he didn't eat his Wheaties
Just like the white man getting too greedy
But he be a needy brother, but he must survive
All in my beeswax, can't find the hive

Innercity Griots,,male,Shammy's,"[Verse 1]
Shammy
Not the jenny on the jimmy on the jammy
A double whammy
Not your mammy or granny
But maybe your ladys a shammy
If she likes to put her nickname on her fanny
Chitty-chitty bang-bang, ittty-bitty brain-game
Hope its not the same thing that I heard before
Rollin' with a chain gang, couldn't be a plain jane
A dressed up shammy is a messed up ho
With dookie braids she parades in the street to the beat
Six-deep, heading for the swap meet
Complete she deletes the definition of a freak
Her body is bad but her girl is sad (?)

[Verse 2]
I met my first shammy on the hillcrest drive
At a funky fresh jam back in 1985
I said damn, whats up with the flim flam?
And the wham to the bam to the thank-you ma'am
I got a Cadillac ride sittin' right outside
But baby gotta keep it low, so we gots'ta hide
But then the DJ kicked in the bass
And everybody picked up the pace
She bumped the rump that had the hip-hop pumpin
And then she put her booty all in my face
Lemme tell ya she was rubbin on my knees with her permanent crease
Turned around and then she was pullin on my BVDs
Yo baby.. i. did. not. say. that. you. could. do. THAT!
Now leave my booty alone and give me cushion for the pushin' on my bone
Hi ho, hi ho, hi ho, hi ho
Welcome to the shammy hall of fame front row
Brought up as a pinky and the stinky up close (?)
Shammy's getting faded on the fellowship show
Hi ho hi ho ho hi ho
Gimme little look [?] and I will go
Buniqua and Batina and Shatima know the pro
Fessional-professional-pro hi ho
From Idaho to Ohio the shammys get the pros
Words from the summit, the shammys favorite homo
Bye ho, bye ho, bye hoes, bye hoes, by ho


[Verse 3]
I went to a shammy convention
Annually given by the neighborhood shammys
Pulled a shammy named Shalaqua aqua green eyes
Camera called the cookie
Aww, sookie sookie
Aww took me took me to the back
She laid me on my back
Lookie lookie lookie here, she was waitin to sip the cognac
Oh shit, baby baby please- draws and t-shirt
Laid her on the floor, wore her out without a doubt
Shalaqua cock-a-rocka bull shammy is a ballers best friend
You'll agree-
A party over here, a party over there
A party in your mouth and the fellowship was comin'

[Verse 4]
Well my story starts way back in eighty-deuce
When my nuts started swellin' and developin' juice
The shammys in my hood used to get loose
That's when I started noticing the big caboose
A big black booty stuffed in them jeans
It was a halified- shammified calendar queen
Walked over to me and she said ""what up?""
Caught me by surprise so I said ""what up?""
She said ""my name's Shaniqua, you can call me Shay-Shay
You can call me baby, but don't call me baby""
She was proper, no bullsharkin' well hey hey
So Acey starting shootin' game like an AK
I said whom-whoom-whoom-whoom-whoompty-woom
Start shakin' that junk in the trunk for the crew
Now I love laquita, prashonda, and petunia
Not Jimmy Shammy Baker or Shammy Davis Jr
Here in LA, all down in Alabamy
Or over down the east coast down in Miami
A certain type of twang-thang learned from my mammy
It's called the flim-flammy and she's called the shammy


[Verse 5]
Shammy
I refuse to call a girl the shammy
Don't let 'em fool ya
Even though they call you a Jezebel
Skeezer groupie gold-digger bitch, well, tramp
Strawberry stank-ho queen- it seems they know not what these words mean
Check my keen senses, princess
Black beauty, nice duty, black pearl, fly girl
Don't stop, dark and lovely chocolate drop
Brown sugar blackberries of hip-hop, sold
Sugar Dumpling let me tell you something
Mature and slender, young and tender
Nothing will hinder my full surrender to our nations pearls
Black girls"

[Verse: Aceyalone]
Well, I-za, heat mizer, and I'm wiser
Than any other rapper no matter the size of
Girl or guys-a, they all dies-a
I ship 'em up and take 'em up to Kaiser
Third floor, hospital ward
Doctor, his spinal cord's tore
His final words roared:
""I don't want no more, I don't want no more, lord, life""
Infrared chipper, one for the gipper
Dead like a doorknob, killed in a slipper
While rolling in my rollerblades, fell and broke my shoulder blade
Laid and I prayed
Then I grabbed a razorblade stayed and I played
Then I broke a mental barricade
Don't you hate it when your ice pick sticks right in the skull
And you gotta pull it out with two hands?
Don't you hate it when your chainsaw's out of gasoline
And you gotta use a butcher's knife on a man
Yucky, yucky, yes, yes
Huckleberry, wet flesh
There's a couple necking in the woods by the trees
Could it be the prince and the princess?
Getting undressed, having sex in the moonlight, freeze

Take a swig and spark up the spliff (boom!)

John Wayne got smoked when I popped the trunk
Punk, I told you once and I won't tell you twice
I smoke the blunts and we won't pay the price
For pussy or any fucking mass
But the raw dog style in your girl's ass

Fucks up you all when the nuts have a ball
Cause we don't play, blast brains with the smoker
Get fucked up when we toke with the joker
And, never let me see you crying
Heads start to flying, it's time for the dying
And I'mma get real deep, fall into a sleep
Knock a freak in my sheets, man, fuck counting sheep

Cause when I sit back and think back on how you flam me
It make me react and be at my fucking jammy

I just kick back with six-packs and then I do her
But she gets stuck on clawing like a cat
And cause them toes got sucked on she don't know how to act
Back in the days, I.S. 237
Used to run with Kevin, bagging hoes was like heaven
Eleven years later I try to hide
And hope they pass me by like I'm The Pharcyde
Just let me puff and lounge with my niggas
Don't have no time to fake funk with triggers
Don't believe in kids with that puss cat scent
Fuck around with Fash and get your whole shit bent

For some bullshit that you ain't even had to say

If I wanted you killed, you'd already be dead

I got no time for you and all the moves you fake
Taking care of business yeah without no doubt
And I'mma make a million dollars kid before I'm out

One time, I tap yo mind, I got you hummin'
Now you want to press rewind
I pour rhyme in your ear to develop suds
Slice the fuckin' Philly and break up the buds
Who's Buddha? I don't know, is it a special
Stick a fork in your neck and pop a blood vessel
The hispanic shaft packs a gat, too
Permanent scar your ass like a tattoo
Slam dunk the funk in your trunk, punk!
Da Doom Doom, Do Doom

[Verse 2: Fashion]
Yeah, cool makin' moves nigga so smooth
Scarin' ya, hangs up in the 'Skills
But Queens is like the area
I stare at ya, tear at ya, break that back
Now crack the fuckin' sack and roll that shit black!
Act like you want a nigga and watch me hit him
Then I have my shottie' let my brother Divine get him
We got him, ho's comin' through in the clutch
She said I only suck that dick cause I love you so much
Said I only lick them balls cause you so game tight
And you keep my ass climbing the fuckin' walls at night
So hit me, hit me one time, let me flex it
Crew's still makin' moves but now I've gots to exit



[Hook] 4x
Are you ready? Y'all ready for him?

[Verse 3: Juju]
Hold up, you know I gots to get my wreck off
Fuckin' rugged like a dog about to bite your neck off
Police still puttin' fear in the hearts of mad crews
Leavin' people lyin' dead in the street with no clues
Soul like a mother got the funk on lock
You can hear my sounds echo through the urban block
Got stacks of stocks, and fat beats to knock
Got you open now you're hopin' that the junkyard rocks

[Verse 4: Grand Puba]
Okay here goes the blow, the bag, the mint
Grand time to represent flavor so strong
Fills the room like Buddha stick, uhuh, don't like choke
Gotta get paid so we're tryin' to go for broke
Beatnuts hit the rhythm and I join right with 'em
Niggas can't see this flow so it's time to down sit 'em
I kick the flow for the niggas with the bald heads
Dreads, and 'fros, honey's, but no ho's
Oops! I didn't mean to call you ho, bitch
But when you try to clock the pocket that's that bullshit!
So let's get down with one of New York's finest
Seed to the brain like Primatine to clear the sinus
Grand Puba, Stud Doogie with the mad style
Beatnuts comin' with the rugged(Hey You, watch out now!)
It's on motherfucker, can't you see that?
No shame in the game, so Doogie where the weed at?"

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Just think, what if you could just
Just blink yourself away?
Just think, what if you could just
Just blink yourself away?
Jeff X can rock the mic with tooth decay
I be the 5 foot 7
Residin' at the Mecca rest address in South section
Used to cut class in the infinite pursuit of ass back in '86
Easy with the chicks, I was a chocolate boy
Raised in the cellar with the rhythm like Ella
Walked the mega-trife streets to the subway where I lay
'Til the train stopped, then a nigga hopped (Hopped)
Used to do the pop dance to the Planet Rock
At the block party, everybody jocked, ""Who, me?!""
It's the MC sucka niggas envy
I got my contract in 1993, and I shall proceed



[Chorus: Black Thought]

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
I wake up early in the mornin', I mean early afternoon
Break a lyrical hymn of the stim' like boom
I'm fly and when I die, yo, put this shit up on my tomb
That nigga represented on the 28th of June
I'm representin' Philly on the 28th of June
I can make you feel that I'm a surreal cartoon
With my pistol in the face of Hip-Hop, stickin' for papes
Because I'm on a paper chase (Say what?) I'm on a paper chase
My Timberlands are fully laced, I be the Mr. Boogeyman
With records from 125th to Japan
I let 'em play like Donny Hathaway and shake a hand, shake a hand
Your lady tried to kick it, but I couldn't play my man
My niggas is my niggas and she didn't understand
I shake your hand and shit'll hit the fan
Just think, just think, what? What if you could just
Just blink, what? Blink yourself away? As I proceed


[Chorus: Black Thought]
I shall (I shall) proceed (Proceed)
And continue (And continue) to rock the mic (To rock the mic)

[Bridge: Black Thought & Malik B]
Malik B, get on the mic, aiyo, it's too much on my mind
Say what?
Malik, get on the mic, there's too much on my mind

[Verse 3: Malik B]
Johnny on the spot, got the rhythm and the rhyme
Fuckin' with The Roots, you know them niggas is a dime
I can make a 100-yard line start to dash
I can make a whole lake of fish start to splash
I can make Conan and The Titans clash
And I could make Metallica and Guns N' Roses thrash
Used to smash, crash parties like I was disturbed
Used to make plots against the herringbone herb
But now, all I do—disperse the verb
And like a nerd, I can make you say ""He's superb!""
Worded perfect, never ever shall you misinterpret
I move styles like bowels, so now you know I'm worth it
Direct from Philly, the land where niggas scheme
So you know I got that sheen in my gleam


[Chorus: Black Thought]
I shall proceed (Proceed)
And continue to rock the mic (To rock the mic)
I shall proceed (Proceed)
And continue to rock the mic (To rock the mic)
I shall proceed (Proceed)
And continue to rock the mic (To rock the mic)
I shall proceed (Proceed)
And continue to rock the mic (To rock the mic)"
Do You Want More?!!!??!,,female/male,Distortion to Static,"[Intro]
(Laughter)

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Yo, I'm every MC, it's all in me
That's the way it is, the way it gotta be
Indeed as I distort, I proceed, indeed
Gettin' hotter than sacks of boom in my room at the Ramada
For tanks in your memory banks to fill up
I provide the static a scratch to match, while you catch the vibe
Most can play high-post, but yo, that don't mean shit
Because my clique will make a motherfucker sick
I flips, redder than pork, comin' to New York to mix
(It's Bob Power) With the snares and kicks to fix
Rhythmically, you got-ta be, static-y
Magically, I appear, spark a L and drink a beer
With Air Smooth, takin' niggas loot with dice
Then shoot, The Roots, poetic, courageously kinetic
Vagabonds, versatile and various
Trust rap styles of mine are blunt, pain is in the mind
So I'm fine and five-foot seven, inches in height
My mission to strike mics, enlightenin' tykes
Frightenin' like lightnin'
Fluorescent, incandescent, effervescently
I represent, Foreign Objects and Ill Elements
Very relevant, plus intelligently managin' matter
That's makin' tracks fatter
Revolve around Saturn like rings
And brings swings, when I stings with bass
Then distort up in your face like mace
Bustin' your dreams like gats with loaded magazines
I'm on the rap scene, repellin' fellas like a vaccine
As I, rocks from under, blunderin' I'm not
Lyrically, ya get shot, get caught, so distort with Thought, for real
It's the illest out the Phi, short for Philidelph-iada-fly
Money makin', move fakin', I isn't
Niggas cannot front, I'm poetically exquisite
Wicked, with the visit while you're wonderin', what is it?
Dig it, yo, my mellow, um, what up for the night?
Malik B., get on the mic, get on the mic like that, y'all
And yo, I'm flowin', my part of the song
It's goin', it's goin', it's gone


[Hook]
(Laughter)

[Verse 2: Malik B]
Now, go get your dictionary and your Pictionary
'Cause much affliction with my diction friction slips and carries
Words and herds like some cattle in the steeple
People, there's no equal, or no sequel
So policies of equalities get abolished
Demolished, distortion of the static's gettin' polished
Urges of splurgin' words will just be merged together
Damn, it's quite clever, however
You never can sound alike, lyrics don't be poundin' like
These, troops, who be's, Roots
Insult ya, mellow by culture, rhythmatic vulture
Approach ya with Magnetic shit that's Ultra
I make MC's dangle like a bangle, strangle from every angle
My lingo jingles and it jangles under Kangols
Nahhh, them niggas don't wanna tangle
'Cause Roots get loose, negros get juiced like the mango
To be particular, extra-curricular, for pleasure
Measure, in any weather, value more than the treasure
Baby, you're sayin' maybe, then comin' to flex
Now you wonder what's next

[Outro]
(Laughter)"
Do You Want More?!!!??!,,female/male,Mellow My Man,"[Intro: Black Thought]
One, two
Yes, The Roots layin' back, rela-xin'
Coolin' out with my man Malik B, we call him Sla-xon
YaknowhatI'msayin?
We in Effect Mode like Al B. Sure, for your plea-sure
Aiyyo, bust it
We 'bout to flip it on some ol' laid back, mellow my man tip
We gon' set it like this
Yo, check it

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Bust it, La Di Da Di, who likes to party like Slick Rick the Ruler?
I'm cooler than a ice brick
Got soul like those Afro picks with the black fist
And leave a crowd drippin' like John the Baptist
It's the cause of that ""Oh, shit!""
The skits I kick flows like catfish
And got many MC's on the blacklist
I'm sharp as a cactus, plus, quick to bust gymnastic tactics
Us Roots is really true to that rap shit
Now, holla to the scholarly street skats that follow me
Back to the Soul Shack with packs of rap colonies
Max that, Foreign Objects is mad abstract
Make Shadrach offender wanna go like Meshach
Black Thought the nappy cat, a bookworm, shoot styles like sperm
Cool as Malcolm Little with conch a la perm burn
The herb sticks like wicks, and flips when I slaps the hand
Of my mellow my man, Malik B



[Verse 2: Malik B]
Here I goes, negroes best to know the flower
The pro-fessional, best in those skills that kills, so uhh..
WHOA, slow down before you go down (sissy)
Sissy, this is Agatha Christie — you're slain and known now
Next contender, Malik's the axe offender
Critique me so uniquely with mystique that's so deep within the
Microphones I grip, psych with poems so's I slits throats
Put him in a quote when he croaks
They sayin' — isn't it, is it the negro that did it?
Cause wreck with the tech, make you jump and say 'ribbit'
I exhibit many forms, prohibit the corny norms
(And we're in, your neighborhood) on the norms
Capture, was to, whack ya
Manu-facture, you can even ask Anita about the, rap-ture
I figured, perhaps ya, a say it SLAM
For my mellow my man

[Hook: Black Thought]
The way we do it like this
That, for my mellow my man
It's like that for my mellow my man
No, no, we do it like that
This, for my mellow my man
It's like this for my mellow my man
No, no, we do it like this
That, for my mellow my man
It's like that for my mellow my man
No, no, we do it like that
This, for my mellow my man
It's like this for my mellow my man


[Verse 3: Black Thought]
Yo, I got spunk, plus funk
And Jump Like Punks To Get Beat Down
Turn that heat down, I'm crazy cool
Deeper than the pool that Wilt the Stilt damn near drowned in
Clowns bounce to sound when Thoughts poundin', brown's
My complexion, section Southern
My brother-in is Jex, I
Sweats no sex, 'cause this kid gets grits 'n shit
It's flex to drains that was crazed
When your heart spit up, dip, dup, damn
Yo, I lost it, but back is the Black Boogey Man
Manic mad musician, maker of noise
That's jocked by your homeboys
I rocks my flocks of sheep, it's the slickest shepherd around
I was lost but was found, now I gets down
From Philly to the Apple I, stop and holla tunes and then hit
Up-town, Diggin Planets when they get Earthbound
I kick the groovy tunes for you and yours, when I pass the can
To my mellow my man, Malik B

[Verse 4: Malik B]
WHOAHHHHH, shucks! My nuc' snuff ducks (Uh-huh)
Abruptly I erupt, to destruct, deducts
In wax I like to smack 'em, stroke 'em as I cap 'em
Change my name to Saran or Reynolds then I Wrap 'em
Negroes know we be furrow to my borough
'Cause my ass is so thorough, like Levert Gerald
Too strong to be sterile
So I impregnates the greats (Say what?)
Bust the Pacino's, I won't trust 'em, even though I lust 'em shapes
females for retail prices
Twice this nice as with sugars and spices
I won't smirk, 'cause my name's not (You're not) Urkel
The voice with the multiple choice, she does a circle
You wanna turn and page your eyes, and try to plagiarize
But I degrade ya, slaughtered ya and slayed ya
Microphones I grip equipped to flip the hypocrites and nit-wits
With tidbit skits, that ain't *shhh*
It was a curse, but I divide it in half
Gets the airplay, no fair play, you're feelin' the wrath
Of Malik, ayo, that's tragic, negroes that get dramatic
Because I have the habit to smoke rabbits like a addict
So if you can not rap, I will just slap YOU
If you wants to pick up on your nose
B shows the chrome and then we cap YOU
It's too bad, dem cyan't understand de true check
For my mellow my man


[Hook: Black Thought]
The way we do it like this
That, for my mellow my man
It's like that for my mellow my man
No, no, we do it like that
This, for my mellow my man
It's like this for my mellow my man
No, no, we do it like this
That, for my mellow my man
It's like that for my mellow my man
No, no, we do it like that

It's like this for my mellow my man

[Outro: Black Thought]
I think it's for my mellow my man, uhh
My mellow my man, right
My mellow my man, uhh
My mellow my man, right
My mellow my man, uhh

My mellow my man, my mellow my man

Brother ?uestion on the drums, my mellow my man
Gotta end it on the one, my mellow my man
Check it"
Do You Want More?!!!??!,,female/male,I Remain Calm,"[Hook x4]
I remain calm, lyrically, I got the bomb
When you put me on, I remain calm

[Verse 1: Malik B.]
It's the 'I Remain Calm', but for jerks that erk
Come out my humble, go berzerk
And make you swallow your smirk
I splurge most and bash, capacities mass
I fascinate as I assassinate and show task
Characters and egos get crushed in trust
And my words stampede like herds in the dusk
Cream of all crops, topics I drop with Trotter
When heated up, I gets hotter 'cause I'm proper
You never knew the levitude the clever few
Different tax for revenue, man, if you ever knew
The tac-tic, strategies of word ca-pa-bil-ities, display, decease
The rhythm, and man, how it swerved and curved
Made a nigga's dream but his hope deferred and stirred
Dig the mentals, Papermate, Bic's and No. 2 pencils
My credentials flow on instrumentals
I write an anthem, throw a tantrum and remain handsome
Mysterious vibes like I was The Phantom
Erupt abruptly, then conduct, amaze
You're fucked when the lyrics get buck because I graze
Never animosity, on my property
Niggas acropoly, or they feel extreme monstrosity
Wreak and leak out the verbals, Akhi, don't forget it
The chief of edit, the Malik'll shred it, yeah, I said it!


[Hook x4]
I remain calm, lyrically, I got the bomb
When you put me on, I remain calm

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
That nigga Thought flows like a river, I deliver styles like Domino's
Eyes closed, I inhale equality, follow me now, son
Listen, my divisions advance, I surpass one half of the rap mass
The other half want my autograph
Because I got soul, plus a ghetto stroll similar to Shaft
It's the mic rapers, splittin' Phillies in the cellar
My a capella verse can stomp, I delete comp
My rated-X larynx wrecks your context
I'm complex, confusin', lyrically amusin'
I drink brews then when I'm groovin', I'm no longer human
I'd like to take this time to give a shout to all the money makers
In the house galore, they help me turn it out
I whip the cap to the back, I'm laid back like your gramps
I make niggas embarrassed like they spendin' food stamps
I take my time when I rhyme lovely, me, nah like ugly
Like, God, we get odd to ill rhythms
Rappers thinkin' of steppin' up, what the fuck you doin?
I amplify the hymn to bring your empire to ruin
Who's your girl screwin', fellas? Jealous because I'm fly?
Keep my sneakers dry when you cry-baby
See, I can have you headin' for the border like a refugee from Haiti
Aiyyo, this brother drivin' my cab tried to flip
Sayin', ""Pay me in advance"" - I asked him if he ever danced
In the dark with the rap devil Black Thought
See, niggas who get caught off guard remain scarred
Into air, with headphones remainin' on they domes, they hear
I resound and astound and scare
I reign terror into another nigga rap era
My rhymes sedate, I lubricate like Aloe Vera
I'm extreme, restin' in the land of the plot and the scheme
Peace to Bed, Shedroch and the Equal Team

Green fatigues chronic
Drive is masonic
Onslaught is conic

Vampires get garlic
George got the Jack
While Uncle Jimmy be thinking rather pure gin when drinking
Lime away from dry wall
All fall, defense is too tall
Jones for the beats, flip my loop through the LFO
I say tomato, you pronounce it optimo
Let's call the whole thing on
Is it a joint, blunt, shotgun, bowl or bong?
Quite frankly I'm still beneath the table
Doom drank me under
What God has joined together
Let no man put asunder

No, I didn't insult him, I didn't insult him

[Verse]
The toughest musician in Hip-Hop history
He's finally mastered the art of the MPC
Not Primo's drums, due to knowledge, due to change
I go by Dwight Farrell as well as other names
The creator has a master plan, I'm finding my part
I know it's got a lot to do with my art
I mix it up like like a Cuisinart, when I hit ""play"", start
Section a new sound, make it all loop around
For the Vision 1.4 and S3000
I'm wide awake at 7 like Matsen (On and on and)
But the MP haunts me nocturnally
So now I'm tappin' out beats 24/7
These drum machines is like cliffnotes, 'cause I'm used to real notes
On ebonies and ivories to make melodies with
But these drum pads come the banks of sixteen
So I flip these with the music theory that God educates me with

Woke up, turned the drum machine on
Used my instincts to make a dope song
Woke up, turned the drum machine on
Used my instincts to make a dope song"

War chief wanna bring it
I told em’ it’s your world
The coolie high is life
The Stony Walk’s.. forever
It’s the jungle brown shit that got your whole block buzzing
We picking out the fro’s
My disciple camp is coming
Got the bars going hand
Because I’m living like a solider
But not a toy soldier because the Lo’ers never play

Dom cats smoking from the flash, better dig it
Brown honey keep the nappy fro – never pick it
El dorado … keep the head from spinning
Diamonds hit the bricks, making flicks, and we grinning
On the candy ass – beechin’ on the stash they be losing
Double chins running whole camps
And we cruising
To the double time
Call it boogie down if you wanna
Back to the sugar shack – step – be a gonna

Your A-style nada lows out
With the burner on your block and
Weighted cotton
I'm 'bout to set it
Check the method
It’s just the geechie
Running terror, now and ever
That’s how I see it
I’m about to bring it to you sweeter
What’s the word?

Short eyes 'cause the sadder life
Caught up with the sugar love

If we boogie to your right, then cats get left
Every which way but loose we bust 'em down
Here comes the war chief now to buss 'em down

Bushing 'em down
Bet your last war chief of new
Burning the town
Leaving no survivors in the camps
Sparkle their eyes
Get amp and get your ass torched
Check out their glossy eyes when the knuckle swatch connect
Hit the deck
It’s never calm after the storm
Give and go
Running through camps – looking for their ass
Coolie high
Two of the same, shoveling their cash in quick fash
Got em, stick and move and then flash

Working down my own nights
It's time to find my peace of mind
Maybe if I hold my head back
Breathe, I see through my own eyes
Fading in the black my whole life

[Verse 2: The Koreatown Oddity & C.S. Armstrong]
Yeah, uh, looking back to understand where I'm at
Moving forward through the corridor of becoming detached
Even in an avalanche of some fabricated trash
The undisputed truth always gets the last laugh
That's why you see spirits that resemble shattered glass
That's why the future of the world cannot be left in fragile hands
That's why when you gifted, you don't even need to brag
Or act like you better than anybody on God's green land
To be specific, name one motherfucker that didn't start as an infant
I'll wait, no I won't
Ain't no human being existed that ever skipped it
So next time they wanna pick up their shit and sniff it
I hope they won't be surprised that it don't smell terrific
Teriffic, man, my nose!
Change of the guard, the position is shifted (yeah)
And each time it does I'm in one, I can lift it

They telling us what they talking about
This hard as a motherfucker
Make a nigga wanna sing something
I know, I know

Tell us what they talk about

Little Dominiques Nosebleed,,female/male,Little Dominiques Nosebleed Pt. 1 (Ft. Sudan Archives),"[Intro: Sample & Sudan Archives]
Lo-lo-lo-lo-los Angeles, California
Lo-lo-lo-lo-los Angeles, California
Once upon a time in Los Angeles (Lo-lo-lo-lo-los Angeles, California)
There was a boy

[Verse 1: The Koreatown Oddity]
Little Dominique on Saint Andrew's and Fifth Street
So how I got my alias should not be a mystery
Surrounded by the culture, born to be down
I had a Cold Crush Brother cat-napping on my couch
In K-Town, when I was a child, chick-a-wow
He even taught my mama how to freestyle
Sitting on the floor, listening to her cassettes
I'm up in MC Trouble shortly after her death
And some Ice T, some Donald B, some Mix-A-Lot, Chubb Rock

[Refrain: Sudan Archives]
Once upon a time in Los Angeles
There was a boy

[Verse 2: The Koreatown Oddity]
Little Dominique on Saint Andrew's and Fifth Street
So how I got my alias should not be a mystery
Playing Contra on Nintendo with the homie Marquis
Who lived a couple buildings over and was older than me
At World on Wheels, we could get in free when he was at the rink
Or at the crib staring at the TV
VCR playing Moonwalker on repeat
'Cause I used to eat corn on the cob with parmesan
From Elote man on my block and that shit was super bomb
[Refrain: The Koreatown Oddity, Sudan Archives and Sample]
Once upon a time in Los Angeles (Lo-lo-lo-lo-los Angeles, California)
There was a boy
Little Dominique in the car with his mom
On the way to the sitter in a white Nissan

[Sample: Richard Pryor]
Somebody call me a cab
Damn, I'm gon' bleed to death waiting on an ambulance
Tell my mama that (Hey, hey)
Ain't no way to get no ambulance in the ghetto, right?
Unless you call up, ""there's five niggas killing a white woman!""

[Refrain: The Koreatown Oddity]
Finna be past tense, I told you that it's over
Two hundred tree rings, you watch a nigga earn 'em
No health insurance and that's still what I need
You don't know nothing 'bout little Dominique's nosebleed

[Sample: Richard Pryor & Crowd]
And, uh, what you got to do wit' it, little nigga?
(oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey)

[Refrain: The Koreatown Oddity]
Finna be past tense, I told you that it's over
Two hundred tree rings, you watch a nigga earn 'em
No health insurance and that's still what I need
You don't know nothing 'bout little Dominique's nosebleed
[Spoken Interlude: Dominique's Mother]
Oh my god, so we making a right turn, trying to mind our own business, and this fool tries to make a U-turn and hits us dead on. My baby hit his head on the windshield. Dominique, are you okay? Oh my god, somebody call the ambulance. And then, he proceeded to try to keep going and the car wouldn't start. So he got out the car, had the nerve to accuse me of doing something wrong. You big, burrito-eating, taco-eating, horchata-drinking, chicken-catching motherfucker. Oh, hell no. Somebody going to jail tonight, and it ain't gon' be me. Call the police! Somebody call the police. Dominique, are you okay?

[Verse 3: The Koreatown Oddity, Dominique's Mother and Both]
Hold up, hold up, uh
Hold up right quick
When I said I don't fuck with that coke shit, that's one of the reasons
My nostrils had enough problems often with basic breathing
As a kid, I could suffocate in my sleep
My mom run in the room, say 'wake up, Dominique' (wake up, Dominique)
Let's get you cleaned up, there's blood on the pillows and sheets
I know you haven't been able to rest comfortably since the accident
Believe you me, I wish it didn't happen
And you didn't have to go to the hospital so frequently
From a vessel in your nose that is so damaged
Sporadically it leaks on you, but don't panic
Squeeze your nose closed, stop the blood flow
And tilt your head back slightly
Take a chill for a lil bit, you'll be aight, see
Some things in life occur to build strength
And I know that you're just a little kid but God's got big plans for you if you still here

[Spoken Outro: Dominique's Mother]
Oh my god. I can't believe this is happening. Is he gonna be okay? Is his nose broken? That motherfucker gon' pay. Where he at? Did he go to jail? I need to put him in jail, or somebody gonna have to put me in jail. Look what you did to my son, you motherfucker! Oh my god! Oh!"

Chasing the spirit, not the paper and hoes
And watching how everything organically unfolds
Taking hatred from souls and vanquishing trolls
It's human nature to think you in control
But some shit is just outta your hands
And whoever the fuck had doubted your man
Must be on the substance that we don't fuck with
No judgments, but that just ain't how I function 'cause
Self-destruction
You're headed for self-destruction
Fuck the dumb shit, move things around to balance out the feng shui
Born incomplete, like that's heavenly digits
Always receive insights from every decision
They can tax all the wages I make for a living
But the faith is the thing they can't take away from me, nigga (nigga)

Having pleasure and unrighteousness, a lover of yourself, a lover of money, arrogance, greedy, selfish, high and mighty, disobedient to your family, social media is that you? Having a portion of the truth and denying the real power of it. Be not deceived by any means

[Verse 2: The Koreatown Oddity]
No Snapchat, I'm way past that
Got enough apps to distract my attention span
I'm already addicted to the 'Gram and the Twitterverse
Finna put my fuckin' phone down and pick up some literature
But hold on, right quick, I got this tweet I gotta finish first

Little Dominiques Nosebleed,,female/male,Darkness Interlude,"Watching old memories pass
Wondering, ""am I sane?""
I look around, and I see how the darkness surrounds our society
Darkness, everybody!
They keep falling down into the same pattern
They have ideas, and then they grow old
When they grow old they think:
""Well, now is the time to do something constructive""
They then get on the merry-go-round called the circle of life
If only they would have held onto their ideas, change could begin
I look around, and I see how the darkness surrounds our society
They seek the light with false pretenses, so false they might as well be vegetables"

In that dream we lost our teeth
In that dream we jumped off the bridge
There is something dark in those people's eyes
Leave everything as you find it

I know what I smoke and what I say to myself (Yes)
If I don't know, then I don't say it, chitón
Ask permission, ask for forgiveness (What)
The second option is always more viable (Se)
Looking for the point to the weirdest things (Se)
I have been for years ready to jump
The views are good if I feel like it goes
down There, lies and bullets

Dodging gangs, looking for her
The women in my life fight it without a hood
They tell you to your face

have to be crazy not to see it
Skidding the muddy bottoms
Nobody ever pulls my car, come on!
That's why I deserve every door I open
You eat my sticks and my clips (Clips)
We bring it retro, like Tamagochi (Yes)
Low, like fog, like low kicks
Come on, recognize that this is not for you

Pringles, Nestea, sunglasses and weed
With her next to me I melt, and of course (Of course)
I am neither made of stone, nor of the stick (Ahh)

Como una chancla (¡Ja, ja!)
Se, se
Nah, ja

[Verso 1]
No, yo no tengo un don
Yo solo sé lo que me gusta y lo que no
Veo planos desde dentro del vagón, Trainshot
O cuando gira el techo, si me tumbo en el colchón
Pa' hacerlo mal hay que saber hacerlo bien
Mírame, ya me la suda el HD
Cato el analógico con Made in M
Testing, testing, poniendo a prueba tu subwoofer (Bless)
Hazte el sordo, pero te sabe ri'cueso
Lo que suelto cruje como snacks de queso (¡Sclash!)
En mis pesadillas caigo preso y me quitan eso
Pero me pellizco y salgo ileso
(Swifty, ¡ja, ja, ja!)

[Verso 2]
Caía y me enredé con las cuerdas de tender
Dejo pa' mañana lo de ayer
La paso en el tubo como CleanBoy, surfing
Estoy cruzando los dedos pa' salir de él
Todos esperan que les cuente tanto
Pero pa' eso ya no valgo, ahora me lo guardo
O lo suelto de risas mientras monchéo algo
Quiero Cheetos Sticks, no un milagro (Amén)
Cuento baldosas junto a Lasser (¡Ey!)
Rebobino la peli pa' que no se pase (Yes)
Bajo a la plaza y me voy de viaje (¡¿Qué haces?!)

Now we can parle, parle all day
I'll just let you know that I'll be talking anyway

[Verse 1: Omaure]
I wanna touch the clouds, I'm just a passenger
Fluff them up and tell the world they smell like lavender
Behold the finishing touches of an amateur
Then put your fist into the sky just like a falconer
His eyes were colder than dreams of Lucifer
I ululate for aliens and made impressions just to introduce us all The humans called: ""Play that song so they don't shoot us all""
And you don't call Omaure twice like your office tech support
Never pause for applause when I'm doing what I'm destined for
It's a flaming passion like the bottle tops of molotovs
In this corner no one calls the shots, there's no corner boss
I can't be touched 'cause I'm an autobot
I used to spread my wings run quick but never fly
Now I sit back and travel while I'm sippin 'killer wine
It's dinner time and I'm servin' a la carte from the drive-in signs

With a ""Piccolo"" between the lips
I'm making a wooden ladder to climb the tree I keep
stickers in my pocket, Doraemon
I give the ""X"", that's why I don't fall
They have locked their windows (Close)
Your life was perfect inside a hologram
Boy, Get out of the Matrix, fall out of bed
Or change your arms for two wings, fly
Shuffling low for the baguette [?]
With the same Hawaiian as yesterday
If you're in a hurry, don't stop with me (No)
Those whores would kill for my dreads (I know)
Because money isn't everything, even though
I'm cool I'm still in love with my lady
I like the sun better than to the palm trees
And in my closet there are more colors than in the spring, fuck

[Chorus: Omaure & Skull]

And I leave the function
Ain't no money being made
Imma route back to the junction

Imma leave in the back seat

Told that nigga take the back streets
Quiet like some cat feet

Dann blas mir doch einen, Ja dann blas mir doch einen, Ja dann blas mir doch einen, Ja blas mir doch einen

Noch ein bisschen unverständlicher als die Intros von Pornos"

Yo, ich ward irgendwann geboren und davor war alles besser
Aber jetzt hab' ich ein Messer und ich schlitze dir den Hals auf
(Jetzt wird alles gut)
Yo, ich ward irgendwann geboren und ich lebte ewig gestern
Aber jetzt hab' ich ein Messer und ich schlitze dir den Hals auf
(Wunderbar)

[Verse]
Yo, ich ward irgendwann geboren – vergiss den Schal nicht
Der Anblick macht die Menschen immer madig
Zwischen stilisierter Panik und Potenzmittelregalen
Tragt ihr Affen eure Meinung wie einen Haarschnitt eines enttarnten Toupés
Doch die Stadt bleibt die Stadt und der Herbst bleibt der Herbst
Im Grunde genommen ist gar nichts geschehen
Im Untergrunde genommen ist der Negroman sympathisch
Wie Chlor frisch geduscht eigentlich geruchsneutral ist
Yo – aber ihr pisst mich an
Was können diese Fötzchen schon was ich nicht kann?
Die Stoppeln besser weg machen nach dem Beine rasieren
Guck wie ich mich anstrenge mit Handschellen
Dem ganzen Schweinskram den ich nicht mag
Ich soll mich nicht so anstellen
Deine Wackness bringt mich ins Grab
Aber keine Angst, ich bin da und bleib auch wach bis du schläfst
Und singe dir das Lied eines Negromans und es geht:

[Hook]
Ich ward irgendwann geboren und davor war alles besser

Ich hab ein bisschen Hall
Ne-ne, Echo
Hip-Hop aus dem Mutterleib
Yeah

[Part 1]
Der Beat wirft den Kamin an
Ich nehm' ein paar Fußballväter und feuere ihn an
Stolz kündigt sich per E-Mail der nächste Krieg an
Dann spitz' ich mal den Bleistift und trab' in den Schießstand
Mit der Risikofreude des abwaschbaren Tattoos
Und Solariumbräune sing' ich den abwaschbaren Blues
Ein paar abgefuckten Mittelstandskindern mit zu viel Zeit
Vierte Wände zieren Schmierereien, nein
Abziehbildchen von Hulk und der ganz legal gemalte gute Ton
Ich sag' schon nicht mehr „Hallo“, ich sag' immer erst „Du Hurensohn“
Eine Zumutung, die sich bequem wie ein Sofa
Noch mehr über Kohle definiert als Europa
Ich komm' wieder mit Puff statt Religion oder Moral
Vor paar Jahren war „Party-Party“ ja noch „Shoa-Shoa“
Aber jetzt wird am Krisenherd zum Glück wieder mit Salz gewürzt
Dein verwaschener Müll ist ein Rap gewordener Heimatfilm

[Hook]
Und es nimmt kein Ende, es nimmt kein Ende
Und es nimmt kein Ende – nein, es nimmt kein Ende
Und es nimmt kein Ende, Klinken und Grenzen putzen
Mit euch war früher doch auch schon immer gut Schwänze lutschen
Es nimmt kein Ende, es nimmt kein Ende
Es nimmt kein Ende, es nimmt kein Ende
Es nimmt kein Ende, Klinken und Grenzen putzen
Mit euch war früher doch auch schon immer gut Schwänze lutschen


[Vers 2]
Yeah, fanatische Hände in amerikanischen Jacken über sowjetischen Waffen
Mit metaphysischen Plänen, international
Geölte Wünschelruten suchen den heiligen Gral
Aber es gibt einen Kuss zum Abschied
Die ersten Schritte auf Tape und dann die letzten auf Krücken machen
Der Kaugummi in dünnen Haaren, die vom Glauben abfallen
Dein Gott ist nur im Kopf und du bist auch nur ein Schwein
Und ich bin auch nur ein Mensch und ich mache so gerne Fotos
Promo-Sapiens, Promo-Diplom-Oeconomicus
Der Sohn im Schoß der verlogen-dreingrinsenden Portfolios
Hat 8 Praktika gemacht bis der Bombengürtel gepasst hat
Und die bürgerliche Ruhe starrt gebannt auf ihre Tore
Wer braucht bei dem Anblick denn noch Pornos
Essen, wichsen, von vorne – gut, dass ich besser rieche als schmecke
Besser liege als renne und besser schieße als rappe

[Hook]
Denn es nimmt kein Ende, es nimmt kein Ende
Und es nimmt kein Ende – nein, es nimmt kein Ende
Und es nimmt kein Ende, Klinken und Grenzen putzen
Mit euch war früher doch auch schon immer gut Schwänze lutschen
Es nimmt kein Ende, es nimmt kein Ende
Es nimmt kein Ende, es nimmt kein Ende
Es nimmt kein Ende, Klinken und Grenzen putzen
Mit euch war früher doch auch schon immer gut Schwänze lutschen

"Smoke Sessions, Vol. 2",,female/male,Katzenstreu,"Wo kommt die Kette her batty boy?
Negroman, nasty wie Katzenstreu
Immer wenn ich das Micro in die Hand nehme geschieht das aus Verlegenheit
Und weil ich nicht weiß was ich mit meinen Händen machen soll
Mein Körper eine Verlängerung des Unsinns
Jeder der ihn sieht möchte sich instinktiv umbringen
Ohne die Idee des Suizids wäre ich schon längst an einem viel schöneren Ort
Ich zieh mich in den Westflügel zurück
Wir brauchen noch einen Nepomuk für über den Kamin und einen Negroman fürs Schlafzimmer
Warum sonst fragt deine Al immer
Ob sie Mal meine Haare anfassen darf?
Wir sind hier nicht im Scheiß Streichelzoo
Aber auch nicht beim Bund
Also kauf deiner Ische Mal nen Hund
Verbrenn deine schönen Nike Schühchen ohne Grund
Und fühl zum ersten Mal seit dem Internet gesund

Bow down to me
Taken your pride and stuff it down inside

Losing my faith,losing time
Better off you than me

So make me believe
Just take me away from this hell I've created
And I'm afraid
I'm breaking my own vows knowing I'll go down in flames

There's got to be something more that I can live for
And I can only hide
Inside of this sickness for so long again

Feeling your sting down inside me, I'm not dying for it
I stand alone

It's my time to dream (It's my time to dream)

Help me decide if my fire will burn out before you can breathe
Breathe into me

Your feeling
Your freedom
Before you fight

A crown

On a pier
Trying to peer

To slip through

Is to breathe
Into warmth

Three eyes up to the heavens but way below them
But they only beginning with my feet on the ground
Wonder where I'm headed I got money on mind
And my mind on you (get it)
I got rain falling down
Over where my head is
I've got too many hustles
Under my umbrella
Ain't no blues in my sky
Should go home and play some Ella
I hide out in the attic
I came up from the cellar
I've got views from the window
On clear days you can see forever
I'm no daisy just [?]
No ESP just clever
Cue that Badu sample
And play that shit forever
Feel like Missy and Timbo
On that super duper tempo
On the ride to the beach
Drop the top on the jeep
While the sun beaming down let it shine over peaks
Peace
To the homies who passed on before me
And the heart of ancestors who live long before we
See

You blow me till I'm brainless, left my sex pistol stainless
You killed me where it's painless
They say death is beautiful, well it must look like you
So before I die, you should know

You might release my dreams

Or you might release my inner demons

'cause I don't know them but they all know me
And that's just a little weird so I'll keep that to myself

I don't have any real hype right now
I don't even have a real mic right now, but
I'm just singin' on my laptop 'cause I want to
I swear no one else can stop you so

Como Joey, suspendido en el espacio
Saludos a esos chavales aunque ya ni les trato
La lluvia huele distinta en el campo

Copas de arboles como cogollos de otros mundos
Cruzar galaxias en segundos
Decidieron no mediar palabra

Quemando dinamita, camufla'o en mi colchón

Re-spark the soul and rebuild the energy?
We stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemy
Sorry for the night demons that still visit me
The plan was to drink until the pain over
But what's worse, the pain or the hangover?
Fresh air, rollin' down the window

At the mall, there was a seance
Just kids, no parents
Then the sky filled with herons
Saw the devil in a Chrysler LeBaron
And the hell, it wouldn't spare us
And the fires did declare us
But after that, took pills, kissed an heiress
And woke up back in Paris

Can we get much higher? (So high)

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Not for nothing, I've foreseen it, I dreamed it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances, if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Penitentiary chances, the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of autumn
All them fallin' for the love of ballin'
Got caught with thirty rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter-century anthems based off inner-city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport, they check all through my bag
And tell me that it's random
But we stay winning
This week has been a bad massage, I need a happy ending
And a new beginning and a new fitted
And some job opportunities that's lucrative
This the real world, homie, school finished
They done stole your dreams, you don't know who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I won't be satisfied 'til all my niggas get it, get it?


[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Is hip-hop just a euphemism for a new religion?
The soul music of the slaves that the youth is missing
But this is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention
As long as I'm in Polo smiling, they think they got me
But they'd try to crack me if they ever see a Black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldn't sack me
If a nigga ain't shootin' a jumpshot, runnin' a track meet
But this pimp is at the top of Mount Olympus
Ready for the world's games, this is my Olympics
We make 'em say ho 'cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a South Park writer with a fishstick
I insisted to get up off of this dick
And these drugs, niggas can't resist it
Remind me when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever wasn't the greatest, nigga, I must have missed it

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down


[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I need more drinks and less lights
And that American Apparel girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
He said, ""Take them glasses off and get in the pool""
It's been a while since I watched the tube
'Cause like a Crip set, I got way too many blues for any more bad news
I was looking at my resume, feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history, I don't believe in yesterday
And what's a Black Beatle anyway, a fuckin' roach?
I guess that's why they got me sitting in fuckin' coach
My guy said I need a different approach
'Cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffin' coke
It's not funny anymore, try different jokes
Tell 'em hug and kiss my ass, X and O
And kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic ending of that wack shit
Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes
I ain't got it, I'm coming after whoever who has it
I'm coming after whoever, who has it?
You blowin' up, that's good, fantastic
That, y'all, it's like that, y'all
I don't really give a fuck about it at all
'Cause the same people that tried to blackball me
Forgot about two things, my Black balls


[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

[Verse 4: Raekwon]
Ayy, yo
I done copped Timbs, lived in lenses, kid
Armani suits, fresh fruits, Bally boots, and Benzes
Counting up, smoking, one cuff
Live as a red Jag', a Louis bag, grabbin' a blunt, fuck it
Steam about a hundred and one L's
Kites off to jails, buyin' sweats, running up in Stetson
Nigga hat game was special
It matched every black pair of Nikes, throwing dice for decimals
The older head, bolder head, would train a soldier head
Make sure he right in the field, not a soldier dead
That meant code red, bent off the black skunk
The black Dutch, back of the old shed
If you can't live, you dying, you give or buy in
Keep it real or keep it moving, keep grinding
Keep shining, to every young man, this is a plan
Learn from others like your brothers Rae and Kanye

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Not for nothing, I've forseen it, I dreamed it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances, if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down"

[Intro: Kanye West]
I'm living in that 21st century, doing something mean to it
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it
Screams from the haters got a nice ring to it
I guess every superhero need his theme music

[Chorus: Kanye West]
No one man should have all that power
The clock’s ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the power
(21st-century schizoid man)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
The system broken, the school's closed, the prison's open
We ain't got nothing to lose, motherfucker, we rolling
Huh? Motherfucker, we rolling
With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands
In this white man world, we the ones chosen
So goodnight, cruel world, I'll see you in the morning
Huh? I'll see you in the morning
This is way too much, I need a moment

[Chorus: Kanye West]
No one man should have all that power
The clock's ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the power
'Til then, fuck that, the world's ours
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
(21st-century schizoid man)


[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Fuck SNL and the whole cast
Tell them Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass
More specifically, they can kiss my asshole
I'm an asshole? You niggas got jokes
You short-minded niggas' thoughts is Napoleon
My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goalies in
I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He knows he's so fuckin' gifted
I just needed time alone with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind, but couldn't open up my own vault
My childlike creativity, purity, and honesty
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catching up with me
Taking my inner child, I'm fighting for custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my diamond-encrusted piece

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Thinking no one man should have all that power
The clock's ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the powder
'Til then, fuck that, the world’s ours
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
(21st-century schizoid man)

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Colin Powells, Austin Powers
Lost in translation with a whole fuckin' nation
They say I was the abomination of Obama's nation
Well, that's a pretty bad way to start the conversation
At the end of the day, goddamnit, I'm killing this shit
I know damn well y'all feeling this shit
I don't need your pussy, bitch, I'm on my own dick
I ain't gotta power trip, who you goin' home with?
How Ye doing? I'm survivin'
I was drinkin' earlier, now I'm drivin'
Where the bad bitches, huh? Where you hidin'?
I got the power make your life so excitin'

[Outro: Kanye West & Dwele]
Now this will be a beautiful death
I'm jumping out the window, I'm letting everything go
I'm letting everything go
Mmm, now this will be a beautiful death
I'm jumping out the window, I'm letting everything go
I'm letting everything go
Now this will be a beautiful death
Jumping out the window, letting everything go
Letting everything go
You got the power to let power go?

The College Dropout,,male,Intro,"[Intro: DeRay Davis]
Kanye, can I talk to you for a minute?
Me and the other faculty members was wonderin'
Could you do a lil' som—
Somethin' beautiful, somethin' that the kids is gon' love when they hear it
That's gon' make them start jumpin' up and down, and sharin' candy and stuff
Think you could probably do somethin', for the kids, for graduation to sing?"
The College Dropout,,male,We Don't Care,"[Intro: Kanye West]
Oh, yeah
I got the perfect song for the kids to sing
And all my people that's—

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack your money 'til it get sky high
We wasn't supposed to make it past twenty-five
Joke's on you, we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
""We don't care what people say""

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
If this is your first time hearing this
You are about to experience something so cold, man
We never had nothin' handed, took nothin' for granted
Took nothin' from no man, man, I'm my own man
But as a shorty, I looked up to the dope man
Only adult man I knew that wasn't broke, man
Flicking Starter coats, man—man, you don't know, man
We don't care what people say
This is for my niggas outside all winter
'Cause this summer they ain't finna say, ""Next summer, I'm finna...""
Sitting in the hood like community colleges
This dope money here is Lil' Trey's scholarship
'Cause ain't no tuition for having no ambition
And ain't no loans for sitting your ass at home
So we forced to sell crack, rap, and get a job
You gotta do something, man, your ass is grown


[Chorus: Kanye West with Choir]
Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack your money 'til it get sky high
(Kids, sing! Kids, sing!)
We wasn't supposed to make it past twenty-five
Joke's on you, we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
""We don't care what people say""

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
This second verse is for my dogs working nine to five that still hustle
'Cause a nigga can't shine off $6.55
And everybody selling makeup, Jacob's
And bootlegged tapes just to get they cake up
We put shit on lay-away, then come back
We claim other people kids on our income tax
We take that money, cop work, then push packs to get paid
And we don't care what people say
Mama say she wanna move South
Scratching lottery tickets, eyes on a new house
'Round the same time, Doe ran up in dude house
Couldn't get a job
So since he couldn't get work, he figured he'd take work
The drug game bulimic, it's hard to get weight
So niggas' money is homo, it's hard to get straight
But we gon' keep bakin' 'til the day we get cake
And we don't care what people say, my niggas—


[Chorus: Choir & Kanye West]
Drug dealin' just to get by (Yeah)
Stack your money 'til it get sky high
Kids, sing! Kids, sing!
We wasn't supposed to make it past twenty-five
Joke's on you, we still alive (Alive, uh-huh)
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
""We don't care what people say"" (Yeah, yeah, ugh)

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
You know the kids gon' act a fool
When you stop the programs for after school
And they DCFS, some of 'em dyslexic
They favorite 50 Cent song ""12 Questions""
We scream: ""rocks, blow, weed, park,"" see, now we smart
We ain't retards the way teachers thought
Hold up, hold fast, we make more cash
Now, tell my mama I belong in that slow class
It's bad enough we on welfare
They tryna put me on the school bus with the space for the wheelchair
I'm tryna get the car with the chrome-y wheels here
They tryna cut our lights out like we don't live here
Look what was handed us, fathers abandoned us
When we get them hammers, go on, call the ambulance
Sometimes, I feel no one in this world understands us
But we don't care what people say, my niggas—


[Chorus: Choir & Kanye West]
Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack your money 'til it get sky high
Kids, sing! Kids, sing!
We wasn't supposed to make it past twenty-five
Joke's on you, we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
""We don't care what people say""

You give me this muthafuckin' robe before you catch some senioritis! You will not walk across that stage! You won’t slide across that stage! Motherfucker can’t pull you across that stage, Kanye! Who told you? See, I told you to do something uplifting! I’m tryna get you out here with these white people and this how you're gonna do me! You know what, you's a nigga.

'Cause you getting the fuck out of this campus! What the fuck you gon' do now?

[Verse: John Legend]
I'm no longer confused, but don't tell anybody
I'm about to break the rules, but don't tell anybody
I got something better than school, so don't tell anybody

I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Westside, Westside
We gon' set this party off right

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Man, I promise, she's so self-conscious
She has no idea what she doin' in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents'll look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecurr
The concept of school seems so securr
Sophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a carurr
She like, ""Fuck it, I'll just stay down hurr and do hair""
'Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs
Of new Airs, 'cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car, so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off, now she look like Eve
And she be dealin' with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail, and well


[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
C'mon, c'mon, and when it falls down
Oh, when it all

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Man, I promise, I'm so self-conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pashas done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that Ver-say-see!
Then I spent four hundred bucks on this
Just to be like, ""Nigga, you ain't up on this""
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some Ones that's clean and a shirt with a team
It seem we livin' the American Dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us
We tryna buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we'll stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe

[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Come on, come on
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Come on, come on
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
And when it all falls down


[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I say, ""Fuck the police,"" that's how I treat 'em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes, but we don't really need 'em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
'Cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shorty's hollerin', ""Where the ballers at?""
Drug dealer buy Jordan, crackhead buy crack
And the white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gon' act holier than thou
'Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
‘Cause I wanna be on 106 & Park, pushin' a Benz
I want to act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past-due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spendin' before I get it
We all self-conscious, I'm just the first to admit it

And I heard 'em say, nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
From the Chi, like Tim it's a harder way
So this is in the name of love like Robert say
Before you ask me to go get a job today
Can I at least get a raise of the minimum wage?
And I know that the government administer AIDS
So I guess we just pray like the minister say
Allāhu Akbar and throw in some hot cars
Things we see on the screen that's not ours
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far
Where I'm from the dope boys is the rock stars
But they can't cop cars without seeing cop cars
I guess they want us all behind bars - I know it

[Chorus: Kanye West & Adam Levine]
Uh, and I heard 'em say (Ooh), nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
And I heard 'em say
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today (Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today)
But we'll a find a way
And nothing last forever but be honest babe
It hurts but it may be the only way


[Verse 2: Kanye West]
They say people in your life are seasons
And anything that happen is for a reason
And niggas gun clapping and keep to squeezing
And Gran keep praying and keep believing
In Jesus, and one day that you see him
'Til then walk in his footsteps and try to be him
The devil is alive I feel him breathin
Claiming money is the key, so keep on dreamin
And put them lottery tickets just to tease us
My Aunt Pam can't put them cigarettes down
So now my little cousin smokin' them cigarettes now
His job try to claim that he too niggerish now
Is it 'cause his skin blacker than licorice now?
I can't figure it out, I'm sick of it now

[Chorus: Kanye West & Adam Levine]
Uh, and I heard 'em say (Ooh), nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
And I heard 'em say
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today (Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today)
But we'll a find a way
And nothing last forever but be honest babe
It hurts, but it may be the only way

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine]
With every worthless word we get more far away
And nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe
It hurts but it may be the only way

Back when they thought pink Polos would hurt the Roc
Before Cam got the shit to pop
The doors was closed
I felt like Bad Boy's street team: I couldn't work the locks
Now let's go, take 'em back to the plan
Me and my momma hopped in that U-Haul van
Any pessimists, I ain't talk to them
Plus I ain't have no phone in my apart-a-ment
Let's take 'em back to the club
Least about an hour I stand on line
I just wanted to dance, I went to Jacob an hour
After I got my advance, I just wanted to shine

Damn, them new loafers hurt my pocket
Before anybody wanted K. West beats
Me and my girl split the buffet at KFC
Dog, I was havin' nervous breakdowns
Like ""Man, these niggas that much better than me?""
Baby, I'm goin' on an aeroplane
And I don't know if I'll be back again
Sure enough, I sent the plane tickets
But when she came to kick it, things became different
Any girl I cheated on, sheets I skeeted on
Couldn't keep it at home, thought I needed a Nia Long
I'm tryin' to right my wrongs
But it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song


[Chorus: Kanye West]
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky
You gon' touch the sky, baby girl, testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Yes, yes, yes, guess who's on third?
Lupe steal like Lupin the 3rd
Here like ear 'til I'm beer on the curb
Peachfuzz buzz but beard on the verge
Let's slow it down like we're on the syrup
Bottle-shaped body like Mrs. Butterworth
But, before you say another word
I'm back on the block like I'm layin' on the street
I'm tryna stop lyin' like I'm Mumm-Ra
But I'm not lyin' when I'm layin' on the beat, en garde
Or touché, Lupe cool as the unthawed
But I still feel possessed as a gun charge
Come as correct as a porn star
In a fresh pair steps in my best foreign car
So, I represent the first
Now let me end my verse right where the horns are, like uh


[Chorus: Kanye West]
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky
You gon' touch the sky, baby girl, testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky

[Outro: Kanye West]
We back at home, baby!
Sky high, I’m, I’m sky high!
I’m, I’m sky high!
I’m, I’m sky high!
I’m, I’m sky high!
I’m, I’m sky high!

[Intro: Jamie Foxx]
She take my money when I'm in need
Yeah, she's a triflin' friend indeed
Oh, she's a gold digger
Way over town that digs on me

[Chorus: Kanye West & (Jamie Foxx)]
(She give me money) Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas
(She give me money) Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Cutie the bomb, met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said: ""I can tell you rock, I can tell by your charm
Far as girls, you got a flock
I can tell by your charm and your arm""
But I'm lookin' for the one, have you seen her?
My psychic told me she'll have a ass like Serena
Trina, Jennifer Lopez, four kids
And I gotta take all they bad asses to ShowBiz?
Okay, get your kids, but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got up in
We all went to din' and then I had to pay
If you fuckin' with this girl, then you better be paid
You know why? It take too much to touch her
From what I heard she got a baby by Busta
My best friend said she used to fuck with Usher
I don't care what none of y'all say, I still love her


[Chorus: Kanye West & (Jamie Foxx)]
(She give me money) Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas

(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Eighteen years, eighteen years
She got one of your kids, got you for eighteen years
I know somebody payin' child support for one of his kids
His baby mama car and crib is bigger than his
You will see him on TV any given Sunday
Win the Super Bowl and drive off in a Hyundai
She was supposed to buy your shorty Tyco with your money
She went to the doctor, got lipo with your money
She walkin' around lookin' like Michael with your money
Shoulda got that insured, Geico for your money
If you ain't no punk
Holla, ""We want prenup! We want prenup!"" (Yeah!)
It's somethin' that you need to have
‘Cause when she leave yo' ass, she gon' leave with half
Eighteen years, eighteen years
And on the 18th birthday, he found out it wasn't his?


[Chorus: Kanye West & (Jamie Foxx)]
(She give me money) Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas
(She give me money) Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas

(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Now, I ain't sayin' you a gold digger, you got needs
You don't want a dude to smoke, but he can't buy weed
You go out to eat, he can't pay, y'all can't leave
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves
But while y'all washin', watch him
He gon' make it to a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition, baby, look at his eyes
This week he moppin' floors, next week it's the fries
So stick by his side
I know there's dudes ballin', and yeah, that's nice
And they gonna keep callin' and tryin', but you stay right, girl
And when he get on, he'll leave yo' ass for a white girl

[Chorus 2: Kanye West & (Jamie Foxx)]
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down

Why? They mad they ain't famous (Goddamn)
They mad they still nameless (Talk that talk, man)
Her man in the store tryna try his best
But he just can't seem to get Kanye fresh
But we still hood famous (Goddamn)
Yeah, we still hood famous

[Chorus: Rihanna & Swizz Beatz]
I just wanted you to know
I've loved you better than your own kin did
From the very start
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
Wake up, Mr. West! Oh, he's up!
I just wanted you to know


[Verse 2: Kanye West & Swizz Beatz]
I be Puerto Rican day parade floatin'
That Benz Marina Del Rey coastin'
She in school to be a real estate agent
Last month I helped her with the car payment
Young and we alive, whoo!
We never gonna die, whoo!
I just copped a jet to fly over personal debt
Put one up in the sky
The sun is in my eyes, whoo!
Woke up and felt the vibe, whoo!
No matter how hard they try, whoo!
We never gonna die

[Chorus: Rihanna & Swizz Beatz]
I just wanted you to know
Get 'em!

The Life of Pablo,,male,Feedback,"[Chorus]
Ayy, ya heard about the good news?
Y'all sleeping on me, huh? Had a good snooze?
Wake up, nigga, wake up
We 'bout to get this paper

[Verse 1]
Money never made me
Make me do something? Nah, can't make me
Even if the money low, can't pay me
Even if the money low, can't play me

[Chorus]
Ayy, ya heard about the good news?
Y'all sleeping on me, huh? Had a good snooze?
Wake up, nigga, wake up

Pablo bought a Rolie and a rottweiler
Seem like the more fame, I only got wilder
Hands up, we just doing what the cops taught us
Hands up, we just doing what the cops taught us
I've been outta my mind a long time
I've been outta my mind a long time
I be saying how I feel at the wrong time
Might not come when you want but I'm on time

Ayy, ya heard about the good news?
Y'all sleeping on me, huh? Had a good snooze?
Wake up, nigga, wake up

I've been outta my mind a long time
I've been outta my mind a long time
I know, I know, I shouldn't even bother
With all these gossiping, no-pussy-getting bloggers
Fashion show in Gotham, I need another costume
PETA mad cause I made a jacket outta possum
Awesome, Steve Jobs mixed with Steve Austin
Rich slave in the fabric store picking cotton
If Hov J then every Jordan need a Rodman
Man, Jay, they don't really want no problems
Driving in the same car that they killed Pac in
Driving in the same urr that they killed Pac in
Hands up, we just doing what the cops taught us
Hands up, hands up, then the cops shot us

Hold on, hold on, hold on
Wait a second, everybody here, I'm the ghetto Oprah

Saturation II,,male,GUMMY,"[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
These niggas take me for granted, what would hap' if I vanish?
Bet a hunnid they'd panic, my shooters only speak Spanish
Keep my heart with my dogs, keep my car in the yard
I can't drive it nowhere so I'll let you niggas take off
Seen the shit that they drop, that shit not instantly hot
I give that instant re-bop, that replay value go off
That make my value go up, I keep that bow in my cup
My niggas rolling, got that going with a thousand to bust
""That nigga Kevin can't rap, he too sappy with his shit
He don't rep me with his shit, he on that teenage bullshit
And he 'bout 20 and shit? When he let go of that shit?
He'll prolly be a little colder, y'all agree with me? Shit
That nigga need to act his age, he ain't acting like a grown up
Ain't that boy from Texas? He ain't acting like a soldier
Knew that boy in high school, man, that nigga wasn't awkward
And I know his mama, man, that nigga just a liar""

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Cash don't last, my friends will ride with me
Keep 'em in my bag, we robbed a limousine
When the guns go pow, won't bother us again
I don't wanna do it but they keep on pushing me


[Post-Chorus: Merlyn Wood]
Cash don't mean shit, shit
Crashed my last Benz, Benz
Cashed my last check, check
Cash don't mean shit, shit
Cash don't mean shit, shit
Crashed my last Benz, Benz
Cashed my last check, check
Cash don't mean shit, shit

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
Call me King of the Niggas, I need a crown made of thorns
God said, ""Let there be light"" on the day I was born
Step off the ship with the slaves, then I go hit the stage
I just left in a whip, all I need is a chain
I don't trust no niggas and I don't trust no bitch
'Cause people talk too much, I bought a black fo'-fifth
And a brand new clip, that's my new best friend
'Cause I'm a brand new nigga, in a brand new crib
I ain't sellin' no more, but got my hand in the zip
Whitey gave me the check, I ain't ask for the fame
I used to deal with the grams 'til they put the cam on my face
Now I'm evading the law, I'm on a high-speed chase
I'm in a big-ass truck, I tell 'em, ""Get out the way""
I gotta couple of warrants, so I'm leaving my state
Now I'm in Cali today, with the sun on my face
I got a bag of the gas, and a blunt I can face


[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
How I'm gon' move at your pace? I'm busy settin' the tone
You think we runnin' together? I'm in a lane of my own
Don't got no friends in this game, it's me and my brothers alone
They thinkin' that we competing, that shit depletin' my bones
I don't need all that energy, they just fuck up my chakras
I put my heart in a locker, they love me when I'm a martyr
They hate me when I'm myself, I can't barter with that
You watch us charter these tracks, it's sticking like tartar and plaque
I need a parlour of plaques, need lobsters and helicopters
I need peace for my niggas, need darker skin for all my doctors
I like to speak like a scholar, like to think like a nigga
In this world I can't wander, no honor behind the trigger
I could get shot in my back and they'd tell the world that I fought 'em
""We ain't taught 'em nothin' new, but somehow they been gettin' smarter""
That's what they sayin' in private, speaking from that entitlement
We still workin' for titles and makin' tidal environments

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Cash don't last, my friends will ride with me
Keep 'em in my bag, we robbed a limousine
When the guns go pow, won't bother us again
I don't wanna do it but they keep on pushing me
Cash don't last, my friends will ride with me
Keep 'em in my bag, we robbed a limousine
When the guns go pow, won't bother us again
I don't wanna do it but they keep on pushing me


[Bridge: Matt Champion]
Fuck, put ya ante up, riding in the limousine
I'm stuck on some bud I hit, under concrete canopy
Fuck all this energy, you just wanna bring me down
Fuck all your energy, you just wanna bring me down
Fuck, put the windows up, blowin' past the exit now
Up like a money shot, swerve into the sunset
Me and all my boys jet, swerving like a doughnut
Off, off, off, off, swerving like a doughnut

Skinny boy, skinny boy, where your muscles at?
Used to walk to work, eight hours, take the bus back
Ain't no time to stop, ain't no time for vacation
Y'all all want my spot 'cause you know that I am A1
All these pretty girls, they come running to our faces
I could do without, I could move without, I could do myself
I get in a rut, I feel depressed, I bang on my chest
I say fuck 'em all 'til I'm dead

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]
First off, fuck Dolce & Gabbana (Fuck em, fuck 'em)
Racist mothersuckers tryna be my pana (Pana, pana)

Grab the Ghost then I go right back to Ghana (Skrrt)

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
Got a lot of things to say that I could never finish
Told my mama, ""I'll be back, just gotta kill another mission""
Gimme thirty seconds and I'll make off with a billion
Every verse a heist for all your underlying feelings
Got canaries on the window, smell like roses on the ceiling
Oh what a–, oh what a–, oh, how appealing
Candy paint revealing all that bullshit you concealing
Fuck what you been hearing, I'm everything they fearing
I'm black and smart and sexy, universally appealing
Genius what I'm dealing, something they ain't stealing
They prohibited the potents, might give you cirrhosis
Spaceship doing donuts, it's written, I'm the POTUS
I'm focused

[Verse 4: Ameer Vann]
Barre Baby, spilled syrup on my big wheel
You could call me lil nigga with the big crib
My lifestyle still the same, just a face lift
Silly niggas got me running out of patience
My whole life slowly turned into a daydream
I hit the bank with a smile on my face, man
Pretty women always pullin' at my waistband
Used to get arrested, all I get is checks now

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract & Ryan Beatty]
And Waco is far away, I don't even mind

Hi, I live a wonderful life
Should've died twice, wonder who on my side
Life always better keepin' two on the side
Need no music when my niggas arrive
We be in Van Nuys, black van with some white guys
Keep your hand out, waiting for the appropriate time
To ask a question like
""Could you perform at my best friend's birthday party?
With your friends and go crazy, just bring the shotty
Bring the loud one with the blonde hair.""
Making out with Zayn in a lawn chair
They kicked me out but I belong here
Hear these songs nigga, see this long hair, see these videos
Direct these hoes with no budgets though
How the fuck did I land a fucking TV show?
Met all my friends through Kanye West and I ain't met him yet

Just shaved down to the baby face
Clothes on me, guess it's Holiday
Fried, no sides at the restaurant
My sleep schedule like the power here, it's never on
Feeling like the past year a whole escapade (uh-oh)
Four cars, need a motherfucking Escalade
Pack it up like a clown car (honk, honk)
Bet you know my name from here to Hong Kong, bet I get along
Make some commas, karma, watch 'em sing along
Ayy, err, err, butter knife like dancing on a knuckle
In the thunder car, rocked up in the Lumma
Incidental, I be better by the summer
I be better by the winter, I be hoppin' in the rental
Maybe Tesla for all my missus sitting in the Volvo
Damn, shoot 'em down like, hmmm, sorry, do it all here

I'm moonwalking on the sun hot
I used to live where the guns popped
Made some records then we moved out
Turned rap into the new pop
Bandana, I'm the new Pac
I been blowing up, I can't stop
They need my niggas in the White House
I do business with the white folks
Bring that money back to black folks
Flip it, stimulate the cash flow
Economic, but I speak ebonics
L.A. turned me to an asshole
I been shopping down on Melrose
Still a nigga but I'm livin' different
I been looking at the bigger picture
So I don't hear 'em when they talking to me

[Verse 4: Dom McLennon]
I just want a friend to fall in love with
Maybe someone I can binge drugs with
Living like a prince but I'm dove-less
Playin' my emotions, you a dumb bitch
Everybody talking on some gun shit
They don't even know where to bust it
Cry nigga, gotta fuckin' kick back
Gotta leave those soft niggas at the kickback
Splittin' all my problems like a Kit-Kat
I finessed the night that we slipped up
I could let you know where I'm next at
Tell my baby girl where the brakes at
You know I got number one pick stats
Catch me on the field, it's a mismatch
More like an eclipse, she couldn't miss that
Putting my ideas where my chips at

Saturation II,,male,TEETH,"I done been in trouble 'bout as long as I remember
My momma tried to help me but I hardly ever listened
So she sent me to them white schools, I learned that I was different
They told me I'm a nigga, well, now I know I am
I got my finger on the trigger, I'm a project baby
A free-lunch felon, and I'm hungry every minute
Empty stomach, weed smoke can't fill it
If you don't listen to me, I set fire to the building
Need to listen to the children and the weapons they concealing
Hear the voices of a million when I sell my first million
I am bound to go diamond, ain't no luck or surprises
I am tanning on an island
I can feel the pressure, but I see my new horizons
Me and all my niggas getting stars down on Sunset Boulevard
But niggas from the Southside with Xan bars and gunplay
Niggas on that ""Someday...""
If you shooting for the stars, you only headed one way"

Good morning, on this day we become legendary
Everything we dreamed of
I'm like the fly Malcolm X, buy any jeans necessary

From the streets to the league, from an eighth to a key
But you graduate when you make it up outta the streets
From the moments of pain, look how far we done came
Haters saying you changed, now you doing your thang

Good morning and look at the valedictorian
Scared of the future while I hop in the DeLorean
Scared to face the world, complacent career student
Some people graduate, but be still stupid
They tell you read this, eat this, don't look around
Just peep this, preach this, teach us, Jesus
Okay look up now, they done stole yo' streetness
After all of that you received this

Yes, I did

[Verse 1]
You don't see just how wild the crowd is
You don't see just how fly my style is
I don't see why I need a stylist
When I shop so much I can speak Italian
I don't know, I just want it better for my kids
And I ain't sayin' we was from the projects
But every time I wanted layaway or a deposit
My dad'd say ""when you see clothes, close your eyelids""
We was sort of like Will Smith and his son
In the movie, I ain't talkin' 'bout the rich ones
'Cause every summer he'd get some
Brand new harebrained scheme to get rich from
And I don't know what he did for dough
But he'd send me back to school with a new wardrobe, but ayy

For me givin' up's way harder than tryin'
Lauryn Hill said her heart was in Zion
I wish her heart still was in rhymin'
'Cause who the kids gon' listen to, huh?
I guess me if it isn't you
Last week I paid a visit to the institute
They got the dropout keepin' kids in the school
I guess I cleaned up my act like Prince'd do
If not for pleasure, then at least for the principle
They got the CD, they got to see me
Drop gems like I dropped out of PE
They used to feel invisible
Now they know they invincible

This is the story of a champion
Runners on their mark and they pop their guns
Stand up, stand up, here he comes
Tell me what it takes to be number one
Tell me what it takes to be number one
This is the story of a champion
Runners on their mark and they pop their guns
Stand up, stand up, here he comes
Tell me what it takes to be number one

[Intro: Labi Siffre]
Find your dreams come true
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams
And I wonder

[Verse 1: Kanye West & Labi Siffre]
I've been waiting on this my whole life (And I wonder)
These dreams be waking me up at night (And I wonder)
You say I think I'm never wrong (And I wonder)
You know what? Maybe you're right, aight?

[Chorus: Labi Siffre]
And I wonder if you know
What it means what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams
And I wonder

[Verse 2: Kanye West & Labi Siffre]
You say he get on your fucking nerves (And I wonder)
You hope that he get what he deserves—word! (And I wonder)
Do you even remember what the issue is?
You just trying to find where the tissue is
You can still be who you wish you is
It ain't happen yet, and that's what intuition is (And I wonder)
When you hop back in the car
Drive back to the crib, run back to their arms
The smokescreens, the chokes and the screams
You ever wonder what it all really means?

[Chorus: Labi Siffre]
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams
And I wonder

[Verse 3: Kanye West & Labi Siffre]
And I'm back on my grind
A psychic read my lifeline, told me in my lifetime
My name would help light up the Chicago skyline
And that's why I'm (And I wonder)
Seven o'clock, that's primetime
Heaven'll watch, God calling from the hotlines
Why he keep giving me hot lines?
I'm a star, how could I not shine? (And I wonder)
How many ladies in the house? (If you know)
How many ladies in the house without a spouse? (What it means)
Something in your blouse got me feeling so aroused (What it means)
What you about? (And I wonder)
On that independent shit (If you know)
Trade it all for a husband and some kids (What it means)
You ever wonder what it all really mean?
You wonder if you'll ever find your dreams?
(To find your dreams come true)"

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Have you ever popped champagne on a plane, while gettin' some brain
Whipped it out, she said ""I never seen Snakes on a Plane""
Whether you broke or rich you gotta get this
Havin' money's not everything, not havin' it is
I was splurgin' on Tryst, but when I get my card back
Activated, I'm back to Vegas
'Cause (The good life) I always had a passion for flashin'
Befo' I had it, I closed my eyes and imagined the good life

[Outro: T-Pain]
Better than the life I lived
When I thought that I was gonna go crazy
And now my grandmomma
Ain't the only girl callin' me ""baby""

Then put yo hands up in the sky, and let me hear you say
Hey, hey, ooh I'm good!"

Me llamo Roberto
Este es mi amigo Jabari
Nosotros odiamos a la policía

[Verse 1: Ameer Vann]
I got pipe dreams of crack rocks and stripper poles
Of fucking centerfolds
So I got secrets only me and all my niggas know
Of kicking in the doors
I’ll send a bitch to get ya, so don’t play fucking stupid
I know you got the product
'Cause I could smell the money, I could taste the weed
Give me somethin' or a body, only way I’ll leave
I love to watch 'em squirm, I love when bitches bleed
If she’s sucking on the barrel, you can’t hear her scream
So kiss the fucking carpet, this aggravated larson
And then I’m out the door, it’s monsters in your home
Black gloves, mask on, muzzle plated chrome

[Chorus: Ameer Vann]
Who done called the cops on my niggas?
Who done called the cops on my niggas?
That’s the first one to go, the first shot I blow
Who done called the cops on my niggas?
Who done called the cops on my niggas?


[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]
Shotta, shotta
Who be that, the number one shotta?
Put a missile on you when I'm on your blocka
It no be thing, no be issue when I'm off it, off it, I'm off it
I got the magazine for the pistol
For any politician talkin' shit, givin' issue
Another black man in the street, it's official
We riding out the spirit, we go another pistol
Huh, fuck—another cracker
Cop comin' on my block for the answers
Huh, I no got time for your question
Huh, this pon' mi mommy and mi bredren

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
I hate the way I think, I hate the way it looms
I hate the way the things I say incinerate a room
I know I’m tryna change, but it’ll never work
Just end up more broken down than when I started
And that concrete feels the hardest every time I seem to touch it
Started thinking I ain’t meant for life; but that’s too deep
Falling up into the ceiling while I’m drowning
In the creek of my emotions trying harder to be open
Talking 'bout release dates, I’m trying to make it to tomorrow
Internal honesty could be the hardest pill to swallow
So I need two shots of everything that’s on the fuckin' menu
I’m dancing with myself, setting fire to the venue, motherfucker


[Chorus: Ameer Vann]
Who done called the cops on my niggas?
Who done called the cops on my niggas?
That’s the first one to go, the first shot I blow
Who done called the cops on my niggas?

My old friend fucked my girlfriend, I should’ve shot him
Pray to God about him, man, I hit the Lotto
Yeah, my bitch got badder, shit, my ass got badder
And I forgave them bitches, so now it’s off to millions
I been fucking sinning, hit the forehead
Chest, left, right, I’m grinning, asses on the ceiling
And I got mirror feelings, for all you lil' demons
Yeah, you see the chain, 'fore all y'all changed on me
Rearranged on me, suck a dick about it
I hope you get offended, and this ain’t clean shit
This is pissing off the yacht with my bitch on me
Wearin' mink on me, sippin' Cris’ on ya
Bet ya life on it, I came to fight for it

Where the spotlight? Put me in the spotlight
Trust no one that put you in the wrong light
High scream when I hit her with the long pipe
Mmm, ice cream when I hit her with the sweet thang
Do my thing, no, I do not do speaking
Get my shot, point it out like Ruth, man

Watch you tango, dutty wine
She grind on my dick like a hundred times
Shawty love me long when I grip her sides
And slip inside like a Slip 'N Slide
My electric eel do electric slide but—
I just wanna feel on the booty
All on me, all on me, all on me
Make it slow clap like Rudy!
All on me, all on me, all on me
I just wanna feel on your booty
Grab the camcorder, we can make it a movie
Bring a friend with you if you like how I do it
Gold chain swingin' and she like how I shoot it

Navy camo, I'm drowning, but you don't see what it cost me
Turmoil like the Saudi's, hand-me-downs never fit me
Party never fit me, punani never fit me
Damn, time-travelin', Honda-swervin', that's so Merlyn

Land at the bottom of El Toro High
With the precision of a cut from a Zoro knife
The boy spit like he made out of 409
So that's clean, bitch
You can't play with my team, bitch
We rock pink now on Wednesdays
Green looks good with your envy
Mix with white 'cause you salty but this stainless
I'm like platinum and it's painless
I just skip on the beat like I'm Pee-Wee Herman
Hands up for all my sermons
My wheel's turnin', now I'm more efficient than ever
I feel like Ratatouille when I'm whipping that cheddar
You see, you better find your thickest of sweaters
'Cause this ice might fuck around and change your whole life
'Cause we about to take flight

Tell me 'bout limits

[Narration: Common]
Long before we know ourselves, our paths are already set in stone
Some may never figure out their purpose in life and some will
There are a lot of us who are caught up in this hell we all live in
Content with being blinded by rules and judgment
We live in a world where it's more okay to follow than to lead
In this world being a leader is trouble for the system we are all accustomed to
Being a leader in this day and age is being a threat
Not many people stood up against the system we all call life
But toward the end of our first ten years into the millennium we heard a voice
A voice who was speaking to us from the underground for some time
A voice who spoke of vulnerabilities and other human emotions and issues never before heard so vividly and honest
This is the story of a young man who not only believed in himself but his dreams too
This is the story of the Man on the Moon"
Man on the Moon: The End of Day,,female,Soundtrack 2 My Life,"[Verse 1]
I got 99 problems and they all bitches
Wish I was Jigga man, carefree livin'
But I'm not Shawn or Martin Louis
I'm that Cleveland nigga rollin' with them Brooklyn boys
You knowin' how it be when you start living large
I control my own life, Charles was never in charge
No sitcom could teach Scott about the dram
Or even explain the troubles that haunted my mom
On Christmas time, my mom Christmas grind
Got me most of what I wanted, how'd you do it, Mom, huh?
She copped the toys I would play with in my room by myself
""Why he by himself?""
He got two older brothers; one hood, one good
An independent older sister kept me fly when she could
But they all didn't see
The little bit of sadness in me

I've got some issues that nobody can see
And all of these emotions are pouring out of me
I bring them to the light for you, it's only right
This is the soundtrack to my life, the soundtrack to my life

I'm super paranoid, like a sixth sense
Since my father died, I ain't been right since
And I tried to piece the puzzle of the universe
Split an eighth of shrooms just so I could see the universe
I try and think about myself as a sacrifice
Just to show the kids they ain't the only ones who up at night
The moon will illuminate my room
And soon I'm consumed by my doom
Once upon a time, nobody gave a fuck
It's all said and done and my cock's been sucked
So now I'm in the cut, alcohol in the wound
My heart's an open sore that I hope heals soon
I live in a cocoon opposite of Cancún
Where it is never sunny, the dark side of the moon
So it's more than right, I try and shed some light on a man
Not many people of this planet understand, fam


[Chorus]
I've got some issues that nobody can see
And all of these emotions are pouring out of me
I bring 'em to the light for you, it's only right
This is the soundtrack to my life, the soundtrack to my life

[Verse 3]
I'm this close to go and trying some coke
And a happy ending would be slittin' my throat
Ignorance to cope, man, ignorance is bliss
Ignorance is love and I need that shit
If I never did shows then I'd prolly be a myth
If I cared about the blogs then I'd prolly be a jackass
Don't give a shit what people talkin' 'bout, fam
Haters shake my hand but I keep the sanitizer on deck
Hope I really get to see 30
Wanna settle down, stop being so flirty
Most of the clean faces be the most dirty
I just need a thoroughbred, cook when I'm hungry
Ass all chunky, brain is insanity
Only things that calm me down; pussy, and some Cali tree
And I get both, never truly satisfied
I am happy, that's just the saddest lie

[Chorus]
I've got some issues that nobody can see
And all of these emotions are pouring out of me
I bring 'em to the light for you, it's only right
This is the soundtrack to my life, the soundtrack to my life

To my life, to my life, to my life...

[Verse 1]
Simple as that for your simple ass
Ask about that, pretty simple man
I'm dreaming on good for a sicker plan
Sicker than any other nigga could be thinking, and
I can't be a loser, could've figured that
I can't be a lame, I'm cooler than that
I feel I love the fame, then I hate it back, hmm
Thinking now what I should be twitterin' (1-2-3)
Why'd big bro take all the hot bitches?
Dear God, me too, I like the hot bitches
I'll be the underdog, all along, 'til I'm gone
I will live through a song, I'll be strong through the haters

As simple as that for your simple ass

[Verse 2]
Uh, simple as that for your simple ass
Simple way I wish you would've called it how it should've been
They try to tell me they don't get it, they don't underdig
Now I'll be damned I came this far to let a fool live
I gotta terminate the hate, spread the positive
Without it being wack and cheesy to the little kids
So I curse like a sailor and I smoke weed
I am exactly who an older rapper's kids be
And who they love, hands to the universe
Probably think they drug addicts if they spit a Cudi verse
Mad lil' mama switch to Converse without a purse
Long as the booty lookin' juicy and he stylin' on 'em

[Chorus]
As simple as that, as simple as that
As simple as that for your simple ass
As simple as that, as simple as that (Robotic) (1-2-3)
As simple as that for your simple ass
As simple as that, as simple as that
As simple as that for your simple ass (Tried in some) (1-2-3)
As simple as that (Robotic)
As simple as (1-2-3)

As our hero seems to be dreaming in peace
A dark chapter unfolds
Throwing Scott into the most eerie
And unstable part of his imagination
So intense he cannot tell his dreams from reality

Man on the Moon: The End of Day,,female,Solo Dolo (Nightmare),"[Verse 1]
Listen good, I don't have nobody
But what I might feel are the sounds of sanity
Hoping what I hear loops itself continuously
Then I won't be afraid, no, no

Oh, whoa, whoa
Why must it feel so wrong
When I try and do right? Do right
Oh, whoa, whoa
Soaring through paradise
When I'm closing my eyes

Look at me, you tell me just what you see
Am I someone whom you may love, or enemy?
Am I speaking for you and yours, or someone else?
I need some answers, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
My world turns, flippin' the bird
To the ones who figure
Me outcast, no, not the duo
Back in Shaker Heights where they knew who
Do's little brother was a strange one, boo-hoo
Cry me a river, hater, look who
Traveled out an igloo
Cold-cold world wasn't fit for me at all
Look at where I stand at, tall
Clutchin' my Kid Cudi bizzalls
Mute motherfuckers back home, quick pause
Gargle on my mayo
Look at me, I bet I'm the one you think to fail
Floating in my mind, no sail
Ahoy, ahoy

Listen good, I don't need nobody
This is, what you feel, are the sounds of insanity
Hoping what I hear loops itself to finish me
No, I won't be afraid, hey, hey

Man on the Moon: The End of Day,,female,Heart of a Lion (Kid Cudi Theme Music),"[Verse 1]
Please save a kid that needs some help
And I can't begin to think of anything that could help
But the weed is guaranteed, indeed, just what I need
How I feel, upon a time, so recent in time, made me sad
When I recollect how it used to be
Like David and Goliath, kinda like me
And the Devil tryna rip out my soul
Tryna catch a nigga on sleep, no-no
You can try again and I'll be ready
Won't let you kill me in my dream like Freddy Krueger
No, I'm not no loser, I'll see you in Hell

[Chorus]
At the end of the day, day
My mama told me don't let no one break me, let no one break me
At the end of the day, day
Nobody, nobody ever could stop me, ever could stop me
At the end of the day, day
You can't regret it if you were trying, if you were trying
At the end of the day, day
I'm walking with a heart of a lion, yeah

[Verse 2]
Please save a kid that needs some help
And I can't see ahead of me so I move in stealth
Hide and seek within a dream I seem to glide above my horror
Though I feel I'll never be complete inside the dark I borrow
To proceed and remain intact my mental is so unstable
And they talk and judge a man
They have no clue of what I'm capable
'Til I show a side of me no one had thought could be within
I told you, no I'm not a loser, I'll see you in Hell


[Chorus]
At the end of the day, day
My mama told me don't let no one break me, let no one break me
At the end of the day, day
Nobody, nobody ever could stop me, ever could stop me
At the end of the day, day
You can't regret it if you were trying, if you were trying
At the end of the day, day

No, no, no, no, no, no, no

No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Yeah, no, yeah (Yeah)

[Verse 3]
I'm just a kid who needs no help
I've achieved a bigger thing
No cash or check could be more blessed
And if you had ever seen the things I've seen up in my slumber
You'd be shook, stay awake
No need to run, your fate would follow
You should know, not for the faint at heart
This world understands no coward
It's a goal, a simple code, I stay on the grind to the 25th hour
And I know the fight in me is somewhere hiding deep within
I told you, no, I'll never let you drag me down to Hell

The Pink Lavalamp,,female/male,Music (Intro),"[Verse 1]
America got a thing for this gangster shit, well I ain't got it
So if different shit is wack to you, don't cop it
I can only be honest in the shit that I write
Take a trip through my life
Visit the vivid imagery I'm giving you twice
One with the beat, the other when I'm spitting precise
You can't help but say this nigga is nice
But if I don't make a tech spit, you won't respect it
Or cop the record, so fuck it, let me get reckless
If I like that shine on your necklace
I'ma bust shots, go Shyne on your necklace
Drop-top sped off 'fore them hot shots let off
Now your ass can't wear shine cause you're neckless (haha)
Shit, let's get serious people
Real shit really isn't real to you people
This is my life, fuck what you write
This is my genre, fuck what you like, I got

[Hook]
No real family, no real friends
No real escape, no real end
So I'm gon' die with my music
By my side, and that's true shit
No good liquor, no good bud
No good pussy, no good drugs
So (music is the only love)


[Verse 2]
You ever had a fuckin' conversation with a song you sampled?
Smoking as much weed as the bong could handle
I was high looking for some inspiration
A way that I could talk through the beat itself
Then I put on some Graham Central Station
Track 9 on the album, Release Yourself, it said
(Music is the only love)
Hell mothafuckin' yeah, it's the only love
I'm never lonely cause it just only trust
That if it needs me, I'll be there, and vice versa
Can't say the same about these phony fucks
When I was laying in the hospital bed, hooked to an IV
No one even cared if I'm dead, ain't want to find me
Music was right there, my life was touched
So I love music twice as much, sometimes I feel I got...

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Sleepin' on the 2 train, freezing cold
18 years old, wearing pink and gold
No desire to live, nowhere I need to go
Dead tired, but wired from weed and coke
E and dope, speed and anything that could help me
Leave this hopeless state of mind,God saw me, he would note
Forgive me God for saying, ""Leave me alone""
He forgave me, and he gave me
The best thing thats ever happened to me
That's the treble and the bass clef
Turns out that I had it since a baby
Because of pain, I lost sight of it lately
This whole world makes me crazy
But not music, music just makes me
I don't make music, music makes me
So, you can hate me, music appreciates me


[Hook]

[Outro]
Can y'all hear me out there? How y'all feelin?
What's real for you? What comes from your heart?
My music comes from my heart
So this is dedicated to anyone who puts music first
If you would rather sing than breathe
If all you had left in your body
Was the ability to play your instrument, would you?
If so, this is for you
If you would write a song with your own blood as ink
This is for you
Music is not just an expression, it's an art form
It is a tourniquet to the bleeding heart
Music is the helicopter that saves your soul
From the hurricane of life
If music is all you got, this is for you
(Music is the only love)"

Uh [x3]
It's Charles Hamilton

[Verse 1:]
How does it feel to wake up to the feeling
That knowin that I don't give a fuck what u feeling?
I didn't know my life was so appealing
So high that I'm touch the ceiling
Looking down at her with the attitude of Imus
You nappy headed hoes can't find us
I'm just mad at the fact you tryin to blind side us
Lying to yourself like you can ever out shine us
You can lick my nuts while I'm playing Primus
Then wake up tied up to the back of the 5 bus
Why must niggas ever doubt Mr. Hamilton?
Wildin, written, singing, or freestyling
I'm doin the music that you should be zooted to boom
If you could do it man I'm sure you would be doing it too
But this is a gift that was giving to him for christmas
So in the event you think different, dismiss it bitches

[Hook:]
I once was the loser
Now I'm older still the same loser
That's why I look so different to ya
You see the past I see the future
Now my bars is off the chain
Everybody know my name
Ain't no more things around me change
You know who's gone stay the same, gone stay the same


[Verse 2:]
It's all about the Benjamins baby
But I been having different sentiments lately
Do you think these niggas listen when they play me?
Have you heard the bullshit these niggas making?
What's even more bullshit these niggas caking
They think so limited they be givin it 80% of them maybe
But take a nerd that only listen to Shady
Jadakiss and them with a little AZ
James Todd Smith, Nas with a little bit of Jay-Z
Incubus, System and AC/DC
And along with a couple pounds of that he-mi
Maybe you can considerably be me
But I think I made it sound too damn easy
I don't know what you think you doin but it ain't rapping
You hiding behind the mic like Jermaine Jackson
Lights, camera, action, bastard

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
Yo Kirk pass me the Jesus juice
So I can get deep up in these beats like roots
This isn't a verse, man, this is beat abuse
Tape up the microphone before I leave the booth
I'm a beast in booths, a nightmare in Nike Airs
A nice dream of ice creams the Nike fiend
Rakim rockin light pink
I'll leave Harlem mc's running quick to give em light feet
No A.G. involved, just me involved
Me and my MGM squad, Demevolist, I know you see them dog
Niggas wanna beat us up, they girl beat us off
Married to the game, not no prenup ya'll
Life's a bitch, yeah she a beat-up dog
Quick to wife her, no reason, shorty got her teeth up dog
Before the bitch try to eat up Charles
I throw her a fuckin peanut jar, tell her, ""Feast up broad""
You see I got my feet up, doll
Illest rapper that you seen thust far
Fuck ya'll, I'm nice as fuck, ya'll, so fuck em all"
The Pink Lavalamp,,female/male,She's So High,"[Produced by Charles Hamilton]

[Verse 1: Charles Hamilton]
Met her at a rave, never stopped grooving
Lost in a trance from the Telepopmusik
I was so gone, she was so there
I know I'm intoxicated but I don't care
Lights keep flashing, she keeps dancing
She's trying to figure out why I keep glancing
This is my chance, I don't want to miss it
Eye contact, something feels different
Two new worlds, our galaxy is distant
I send my radiation, she started drifting
Teleport her over my way that instant
Grabbed her, leaned in her ear and whispered
If your too high and you can't listen
Tune in to the new transmission
Step out of life and make the transition
Step out of life and make the transition

[Chorus: Charles Hamilton]
She's so high, she reached the sky
Look into her eyes, she's so high
She lives inside the clouds, her silence is loud
She screams without a sound, so profound
She's high


[Verse 2: Charles Hamilton]
Left from the rave, hopped in a spaceship
Off to the hard drive, west of the matrix
I was so high, didn't think I could make it
Plus I kept envisioning the woman I was taking (home)
Get her naked (clothes), baby take it (slow)
Ain't no way we gotta (go), I lay in my all pink UF(O)
Land on a lilypad then we (coast)
Pour some digital champagne then (toast)
The bubbles from the champagne make us (float)
Aquatic clouds now we (both) need a (boat)
She's the high I need the most
More than a woman, less than a queen
Stuck in between, reality and dreams
This feels like a movie scene
She's holographic without the screen, knah mean?

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Charles Hamilton]
She's so high
She's so high
She's so high
She's so high

The Pink Lavalamp,,female/male,Voices,"[Talking]
Can I be honest with you man?
I think I’m going crazy
For real
Niggas got me in my shit right now
It’s like I’m hearing voices and shit
Word

[Verse 1]
I’m not too sure but I think I’m starting to lose it
Reality is moving too fast for me to do shit about it
Patience is actually a nuisance
I’m picking up too much slack for me to move quick
So many areas asking me to do shit
All I fucking hear is “do that for me then do this”
Sometimes I swear I’d rather be reclusive
I put up with so much crap because of music
These days killing me, somebody coming at my creativity
For Pete's sake please wait, each beat made diligently
I sample my beats but niggas can’t hold a candle to me
And I’m Lyrically Gifted, I dismantle a beat
Put two and two together, it’s a mantelpiece
Inside a chapel, I am the shit and I know it
But the better the music than the closer the psychosis

[Hook]
It’s the voices
All I hear in my head are these voices
Can’t run can’t hide, it’s the voices
Some deem in my mind it’s the voices
I can’t avoid it
It’s the voices
Some deem in my mind it’s the voices
Can’t run can’t hide from the voices
All I hear in my head are these voices
I think I’m losing my mind


[Verse 2]
My short temper is shortened when I’m faced with shit that isn’t important
I want to see the end of this horseshit, bullshit, regardless it’s a rodeo
Bunch of niggas are critics, but they don’t really know me though
Hit me with the okie-doke, you sound like so and so
I guess being different means you’re being the same
Compare me to Em, cause he is insane
The next best is Kanye, cause I sample and dress prep
I guess yes, but what the fuck do you expect?
Label to un-labeled, place them on one table
Make them feel unable to break away from that one place they take you when they don’t know what to make of you
I been chasing this dream since 13, years later still don’t know what work means
Got a slew of ideas like a musical genius
But I still gotta come up with my name for my first single

[Hook]
It’s the voices
All I hear in my head are these voices
Can’t run can’t hide, it’s the voices
Some deem in my mind it’s the voices
I can’t avoid it
It’s the voices
Some deem in my mind it’s the voices
Can’t run can’t hide from the voices
All I hear in my head are these voices
I think I’m losing my mind


[Verse 3]
See I thought of death in a sense of innocence and since there was a form of millitance
That’s my frame of mind and I been in it since my birth
At funerals I would pretend that it hurts, but it didn’t
So I figured it’s worth living at first
But I’m a quitter so the minute it hurts
I’m a sit in that hearse to be dipped in the dirt
Finished with all the sinners in thoughts
And while the minister talks I rock the casket
Standing up, screaming out “Fuck you bastards” you placed me here
You and the voices you made me hear
Absolute silence, the crazy tears
I made my point; hearing voices caused my nuts to curl
You know it’s bad when you can’t trust your girl
Life’s a bitch, what’s she touching me for?
Think it’s time we had a fucking divorce
I don’t love her no more

[Hook]
It’s the voices
All I hear in my head are these voices
Can’t run can’t hide, it’s the voices
Some deem in my mind it’s the voices
I can’t avoid it
It’s the voices
Some deem in my mind it’s the voices
Can’t run can’t hide from the voices
All I hear in my head are these voices
I think I’m losing my mind"
The Pink Lavalamp,,female/male,The Boy who Cried Wolf,"(Intro)
Ya'll niggas never want to listen to me huh?
Nobody want to believe me
Just the boy who cried wolf huh?

[Verse 1]

If I had a dollar every time I heard ""This nigga rap?
The fuck this nigga got on? This shit is wack""
I swear by now I'd have a Benjamin stack
Could spend it on crap and then get it back in 10 minutes flat
This is a fact, no matter my ability to rip on the track
And spit 'till I black
Ball up a fist just to crack an instrumental
No fixing it back
I guess a nigga's style ain't a witness to that
Favorite color is pink, favorite genre is rock
But I can promise you hot hip-hop I'm not gonna stop
In cyphers, they used to get annoyed when I look
I don't even look the part, I enjoyed the wild looks
Cause as soon as I deployed my rhyme book
Niggas was thinking it was the boy who cried wolf
And they got eaten, they stopped speaking
I used to want to flip, but niggas will want to hate
They want to jump me, go Winky Wright on my face
Two Spanish pricks couldn't stand the kid
Gave me two black eyes looking like I wore stunner shades
Ain't get mad, just mad depressed, but forgot I had mad connects
Slip my nigga 50 cash to whoop his ass, while I sit and laugh
Looked at him on the ground like ""I said I'd get you back"" but...


[Hook]
(They don't wanna believe me)
(They don't wanna believe me)
(They don't wanna believe me)
Haha, you don't wanna believe me nigga?
Now your dumb ass layin' there with four black eyes

The truth shall set me free
But ya'll niggas won't let me be
Cause ya'll don't want to believe me huh? Huh?
Cause ya'll don't want to believe me huh? Huh?

The truth shall set me free
But ya'll niggas won't let me be
Cause ya'll don't want to believe me huh? Huh?
Cause ya'll don't want to believe me huh? Huh?

[Verse 2]

My wife been a pestilence ever since I cheated with the next chick
She feels disrespected. In essence, yes, it's wack what I did
But shit, bitch, get over it
Cause this is ruining what we got
She loves me, but trusts me not
Nah, I ain't a player, I just crush a lot
Literally, my high school crush was hot
I ain't gonna lie, yea we fucked a lot
Touched a spot, and yea I really did catch feelings
But it's over, she was a drug and now I'm sober
Now my girl treating me like a convict
So what I'm honest, I'm still trifling
Same nigga undercover wifing hoes and still piping hoes
But I know when I get home I gotta deal with the psycho
Babe I'm not cheating, I been stopped creeping
She ain't hearing it, god forbid it goes down on her period
End of story, period
Now I gotta deal with this shit for 5 days (and hey yo..)
I guess it's her way or the highway
Now I'm a liar, caught up in a fire
""I know about Makeda, but who the fuck is Nya!?""
She's still a rider, but I can't provide the truth
In her eyes no matter how hard
I try, why would I lie?
Lies are lies but, why should I share the truth?
God damn, why am I here?
I'm being honest with you, but why should I care?
It's cause...


[Hook]
(They don't wanna believe me)

The truth shall set me free

Hot tub, bad to the bony, I'm Tony
As my Grandmama Edna Mae Kearse, she showed me
How to be the smooth operator, dominator
In the state of Georgia, hip hop standard destroyer
Leave a muthafucka open like a foyer
He from the dirty, now here come the paranoia
A lawyer couldn't object or disrespect the technique
Sweat me, wipe off the sweat
Fight off the shit and flush the waste down
The pipes of my life flow deep into the ground
Find my purpose on the surface of this Earth, this
Planet's standards trust and the purpose
Campaign in vain for the same lame fame
You've obtained, you ought to be detained
By the hip hop sheriff, locked up, no possibility
Of getting out because the shit you make is killing me
And my ears, and my peers
I hear the end is near, no fear, we disappear
Then reappear again in a fresh new light
I hope it's peaceful and cloudy
'Cause if it's not, we gotta fight like

I just want you to know how I feel
Feeling good, feeling great

Feeling great, feeling good, how are you?"
Speakerboxxx / The Love Below,,male,Unhappy,"[Intro: Unnamed Man + Big Boi]

To dwell in earthly hell
A pimp warrior fell
One-two! Sir Lucious L. Left Foot in the motherfuckin' booth!
Lucious! Sir Lucious!
Sir Lucious Left Foot, has just entered

Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
First rule in this thang: never let 'em see you sweat
Never let 'em be a threat
And your feelings you must protect 'em, as well as your rectum
Must keep self out of harm, out of danger's way
Let strangers play while you graduate and move on
True happiness is not acquired and you won't find it for sale
Unless you're in jail and trying to get a bail
Bondsman to go on and post that bail
You would be happy as hell
You thought you was happy until that court date came
Couldn't abort that case
Nobody to take your place, family members at stake
Too late to escape and get on the run


[Hook: Debra Killings & Sleepy Brown]
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked

When your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked

[Verse 2: Big Boi (Sleepy Brown, Debra Killings)]
Once upon a rhyme, one time when I was a child
(Flip that smile upside down now!)
When I found out that Santa Claus was nothing more than Vanilli
It was silly, 'cause my mom and pop, they worked for every penny
Didn't have many but had enough to get by, enough to get fly
Only to start the New Year off in debt
Now you forget your happiness came and went
Like mom and dad's relationship
Take a trip, you bring potato chips, I'll bring the (hot sauce!)

[Hook: Debra Killings & Sleepy Brown]
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked


[Verse 3: Big Boi (Debra)]
1979, Dirty South, local lounge
(Flip that smile upside down now!)
I never thought that alcohol could ease the notion of the sadness
Now what done used to be a happy home done turned into some bad shit
Graphic, language, mild violence and the silence of the the fams
No members to remember but I know just who I am
I've grown into a man and like my nigga said
We executed the dungeon plan 'cause we got that (Hot sauce)

[Hook: Debra Killings & Sleepy Brown (Debra)]
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
(Flip that smile upside down now)
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
(Flip that smile upside down now)
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done

I'm your r-o-l-a-i-d-s, release the squeeze or release the keys
To the shackles on her wrist, she can tackle some of this
Smack on smack on some of this Dick Tracy
Arrest her, book her, fingerprint your hooker
You took her to the club and now her body is full of liquor
Off that Butterscotch Schnapps and Bailey's Irish Cream
She's a damsel in distress impressed with stylish things

Oh, lord, how can it be so hard?
To put on a pair of panties much less a pair of jeans or the leotard
But I got to start by complimenting you on your physique
You unique, you best believe I'm gon' skeet once I speak
Spoke, spit, spatter, spat and I macked her just like that
But it takes years of perseverance and experience to get that cat
So why don't I chase this Hennessy down with some of that
On your back, like a cheerleader missing the final stack
As we strut, skip the line through the glass window, glance
We look fine, right on time as we step in the place
The nursery's crunk, we've come to play

[Verse 3: Sleepy Brown]
Everybody's watching cause them furs just hit the door
While the gator's creeping, crawling, oh so wicked across that floor
To the V.I.P. where we proceed to give you what you need
Throw your hands up if you feel me
Throw your hands up if you feel me
'Cause we well designed, like the finest wine
Feel good to be fly, so don't you ask me why
I got the ladies in line, because they can't deny
So raise your hands to the sky, 'cause we super fly

Ready for action, nip it in the bud
We never relaxing, OutKast is everlasting
Not clashing, not at all
But see, my nigga went to do a little acting
Now, that's for anyone asking, give me one pass 'em
Drip-drip-drop, there goes an eargasm
Now you cumming out the side of your face
We tapping right into your memory banks—thanks!

The whole room fell silent, the girls all paused with glee
Turning left, turning right, are they looking at me?
Well I was looking at them, there there on the dancefloor
Now they got me in the middle, feeling like a manwhore
Especially the big girl
Big girls need love too, no discrimination here, squirrel
So keep your hands off my cheeks
Let me study how you ride the beat, you big freak
Skinny-slim women got the cameltoe within them
You can hump them, lift them, bend them
Give them something to remember
Yell out ""Timber!"" when you fall through the chop shop
Take a deep breath and exhale
Your ex-male friend/boyfriend's boring as hell
But let me listen to the story you tell
And we can make moves like a person in jail
On the low, ho

Hey, baby, girl, don't you stop it
Come on, lady, dance all around me

You driving me out of my, out of my mind

If I could, I would just be with you, baby
Oooh, 'cause you light me, and excite me

The Life of Paul,,male,Ultralight Beam (Dorian_Ye Version),"Intro: Kirk Franklin & Choir]
Father, this prayer is for everyone that feels they're not good enough
This prayer's for everybody that feel that they're too messed up
For everyone that feels they've said ""I'm sorry"" too many times
Let them know that's why you took the nail
So we could have eternal life
If all God's children would get down on their knees and pray
And give up all of those things that pull our hearts away
You will forgive all of our wrong and make us brand new again
But I won't make it, God, if you let go of my hand
That's why we need more (Faith!)
Yes, I'm searching for you, I'm looking for (More!)
Yes I am, in Your arms is where I feel (Safe!)
They're killing our babies in the streets, I call out for (War!)
I need just a little bit more of some (Faith!)
Just a mustard seed, I'm looking for You for (More!)
Prayer for our homes and our families
We just wanna be (Safe!)
Can't you hear the trumpet sound, I think I hear (War!)

[Intro 2: Samoria Green & Natalie Green]
Give me a ring
Are you ready
Hallujah, hand over Satan
Jesus, Hallelujah (Yes, God!)
Praise the Lord (Yes, God!)
We don't want no devils in the house, God (Yes, Lord!)
We want the lord (Yes, Jesus!)
And that's it (Yes, God)
Hallej- hand over Satan (Yes, Jesus!)
Jesus praise the Lord (Yes, God!)
Hallelujah, God (Yes, God!)
We don't want no devils in the house, God (Yes, Lord!)
We want the lord (Yes, Jesus!)
And that's it (Yes, God!)
Hallej- hand over Satan (Yes, Jesus!)
Jesus praise the Lord (Yes, God!)

Deliver us serenity
Deliver us peace
Deliver us love, yeah
We know we need it

And end my holy war

[Verse 1: Kelly Price & Choir]
So why send oppression not blessings?
Why, oh why'd You do me wrong? (More!)
You persecute the weak
Because it makes You feel so strong (Safe!)
Don't have much strength to fight
So I look to the light (War)
To make these wrongs turn right
Head up high, I look to the light
Hey, 'cause I know that You'll make everything alright
And I know that you'll take good care of Your child
Oh, no longer am afraid of the night
'Cause I, I look to the light

[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]
When they come for You, I will shield Your name
I will field their questions, I will feel Your pain
No one can judge
They don't— they don't know
They don't know
Foot on the Devil's neck 'til it drifted Pangaea
I'm moving all my family from Chatham to Zambia
Treat the demons just like Pam
I mean, I fuck with your friends, but damn, Gina
I been this way since Arthur was anteater
Now they wanna hit me with the woo wap, the bam
Tryna snap photos of familia
My daughter look just like Sia, you can't see her
You can feel the lyrics, the spirit coming in braille
Tubman of the underground, come and follow the trail
I made “Sunday Candy,” I'm never going to hell
I met Kanye West, I'm never going to fail
He said, ""Let's do a good ass job with 'Chance 3'""
I hear you gotta sell it to snatch the Grammy
Let's make it so free and the bars so hard
That there ain't one gosh darn part you can't tweet
This is my part, nobody else speak
This is my part, nobody else speak
This little light of mine
Glory be to God, yeah
I'ma make sure that they go where they can't go
If they don't wanna ride, I'ma still give 'em raincoats
Know what God said when He made the first rainbow
Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro
Ugh, I'm just having fun with it
You know that a nigga was lost
I laugh in my head
'Cause I bet that my ex looking back like a pillar of salt
Ugh, 'cause they'll flip the script on your ass like Wesley and Spike
You cannot mess with the light
Look at lil' Chano from 79th

I'll do anything for a way out
Of my head

[Verse]
In my own way, this feel like livin'
Some alternate reality
And I was drownin', but now I'm swimmin'
Through stressful waters to relief
Yeah, oh, the things I'd do
To spend a little time in Hell
And what I won't tell you
I'll prolly never even tell myself

[Bridge]
And don't you know that sunshine don't feel right
When you inside all day
I wish it was nice out, but it look like rain
Grey skies are driftin', not livin' forever
They told me it only gets better

[Chorus]
My regrets look just like texts I shouldn't send

Always said I want it all, but it's not enough

Down go the system, long live the king (King)
Turn the power off and get your water from the spring (Spring)
I'm bringing everyone with me when shit get iffy (Yeah)
I give a hundred and fifty percent
This is the shit that I'm dealing with, but I wish I'd forget
Used to be feelin' depressed, now that I'm livin' I'm a little obsessed, yes
High in Jacuzzis, I be hittin' the jets
I'm showing her some love she been givin' me sex (Bless, bless)
Respect to Adonai
Don't fuck around and be a victim of your pride, why you lyin'?
(Why you lyin'?) Tell the truth, just step aside
I don't got the time to let it slide (Yep)
I'm too grounded, push whips that move mountains
New cribs, blue fountains, these are my surroundings
I've been going through it, you just go around it
But it's really not that different when you think about it

I'm always sayin' I won't change but
I ain't the same (Same)

There's somethin' about it
That just freaks me out
I just want another minute wit' it, fuck a little
What's the use?
Never superficial, you gon' know it when it hit you
Get a little sentimental when I'm off the juice

Yeah
Okay, we're colder than the breeze
But the breeze ain't flowin' like me, motherfucker, hol' up
You don't need to hol' up, yeah

You don't need to hol' up

You take drugs to make it up way up where we on

Then I have her sing just like Céline Dion
Catch me if you can but, you'll never catch me, damn
Whole lotta, ""Yes, I am""
All the way in wit' no exit plan
Already left and the jet don't land
Yeah, the time is tickin', come take a ride, get inside
This is highly different, I'm talkin' fly, got a pilot wit' 'im, uh
Can I mind my business?
Why you trippin'? Give you somethin' that your eyes can witness
Ooh, you're too close

Well, I'ma give you what you came for, yeah

Set the bar so far above par, we can parlay all day
Crib long range with the yard
I know I should probably pray more but you gotta love me
'Cause I save the day, spend money
When I had nothin', shit, it wasn't so funny
Made a promise to the homies nobody go hungry
Look how far we came, still they throwin' dirt on my name
But it never worry my brain
Heads turnin' like a hurricane swervin'
Tell the sun, ""Get up outta my shade""
If they don't get the picture, cut 'em outta that frame, shit

But really I'm buggin', buggin'
Makin' somethin' out of nothin'

Yeah, as hard as it gets: cool, calm and collected
Holdin' my breath, this ain't what I expected
Don't argue to death, pull my heart out my chest
The cards is all on the table, I'm callin' it
Don't say it, I swallow it

Been stuck on album time, I gotta get out to shine

Yeah, tell me you love me, spin me around
Pretty please, pick me up in the air and don't put me down
Seen it all unfold, sat back and watched
Knowin' time don't give a fuck about clocks until they stop

Even though the only thing that she drivin' a hard bargain
More important is I'm kinda sorta out the door but
She put me back together when I'm out of order

Hurt to watch, but helped me understand

It's just I wish sometimes dreaming was as real
As this feeling since I left you

Just why I'm only here to claim
I've gotta make you famous
You're the starring role inside my mind, Nicole
If I could only find your purpose, I could take control
I'm sure we belong somewhere
Not sure if we'll share
Moments, months, or lives, I'd like you by my side
Enjoy your conversation, abbreviations
I can't focus with a lens when you're in sight
(When you're in sight!)

[Pre-Chorus]
Who knew I'd miss the pleasure?
Heal me from myself
Who knew I'd know too much?

And where am I to go?
I just don't know

Someday, you'll know my style's lame

Heal me from myself

Phantom Pop,,male,Take My Advice,"[Verse 1]
I had a chill run down my spine
Should've taken my advice
Does it look like I'm surprised?
A lot of thought can paralyze
What's in this part of my skin that hides?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Away from the daylight, into the rain
I miss what I hate, but she's my soulmate
We're making mistakes, I'm taking a break
Don't even ask why

Can't you tell I'm trying hard not to seem entranced by relationships and girls?

Sick of saving every dime
Written out of 9 to 5's
Gotta mix and multiply
Rent another suit and tie
What's in this part of my skin that hides?

Away from the daylight, into the rain
I miss what I hate, but she's my soulmate
We're making mistakes, I'm taking a break
Don't even ask why

I wanna know if you think about me half as much as I think of you
Can't you tell I'm trying hard not to seem entranced by relationships and girls?

[Verse 3]
I won't let it die
Did you catch the news tonight?
Caught a glimpse and wondered why
Gotta watch the daily crime
Unless you wanna fall behind
What exists doesn't have to bring fright

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I'm making my way by railroads and lakes
I miss what I hate, and it's hard to take
We're making mistakes, I'm taking a break
Don't even ask why

[Chorus]
I wanna know if you think about me half as much as I think of you
Can't you tell I'm trying hard not to seem entranced by...?

Det er bare det Cosmos har lurt oss for
Nei, men ...
Tenk Sony, Universal, Warner
Poenget mitt er ikke det
Poenget mitt er at hvis du er myndig og du er 18 år ...
Det er fair
Det heter dårlig kontrakt
Ja, det er det du har gjort
Jeg snakker om å bli knulla i rompa
Det er sikkert ikke okay å si, men
Ja, jeg vil ikke det

[Vers: Magdi]
Jeg kalte en spade for spade
Det er spa det
Men den som vil klage på spaden
Må grave
Jeg gravde som faen
Og har rett i den saken
Tar saken til retten
Og retten til graven
Og de kan ha smarte advokater

Men Abdel og Patel har
Stamina, stamina, stamina, stamina
Kanskje vi taper men slangen er halshugga

Popping Patron with Missy in the 600 with no see-through
Suffer the repercussion fucking with shit like this

Constantly making niggas suffer the consequence
Gotta get these ends bitch
House in the Chi with a Caddy, crib in Atlanta with a Benz
Niggas been huffing and puffing but ain't try shit
Got plenty motherfuckers that'll ride quick
Besides, kid wanna bust?
Trigger finger itch when you fucking with me
Jealous because I live more plush
Me and Missy leave a nigga with a head rush
Bring the ruckus, plus...
I'm telling 'em, push and pickin' up profits
For what I'm selling, never gon' stop it
Socking it to niggas and rocking it
Dropping 'em on the spot
Heat up any block or record shop
Knocking you off of your socks
Guaranteed platinum, watch two of the coldest bitches get hot
I be the B-R-A-T, her be Missy
We some bad bitches: who be fucking it up?
I'm the B-R-A-T, her be Missy
And we some bad bitches: who be fucking it up?

Jump in the front, let's ride
Interning at faith but I just got hired
360 with God and I can't get fired
Hot boy but I'm cold standing in the blue fire
Prada from the neck down, don't bother
Deep inside a dream I saw shapes of wet water
(And I felt some type of way)

[Verse 1]
Lusi on the track right, get your track right
We pull up on BMX bikes like the Fab 5
So I walked up in the mall right, did the swipe, swipe
Then I gave away my Moncler in the sacrifice
It's kinda funny 'cause you're so mad and IDGAF
I just wanna have fun
Im switching styles up with the season
Need no reason to, I just do whatever I like
Too many times they tried to do me dirty
Make me feel like I'm not worthy of what I've got
You've gotta keep a very calm composure
Strong and sober, I'll do whatever I like

[Verse 2]
Three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three
Let me know what it's gonna be
Three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three
You better push up on me
For free, for free, for free, for free
I'll teach you how you gotta be
I should've never went to school
I should've been the one to teach
Made it from the kids league to the big finals
It's the nine fold path, noblest striver
If I win I'm gonna get out of the rebirth cycle
I'm gonna hit it out the park and then I'm gonna go higher

[Bridge]
But sometimes I lost my focus
Love does it
And it's never just that easy
No I don't trust it
No but I know what I know
I know what I know (Yeah, I know)
I know what I know (Yeah, I know)
I know what I know (Uh-uh)
No, I know what I know

Jump in the front, let's ride
Interning with faith but I just got hired

And I felt some type of way

Take a bunch of empty words and make them mean something
I've been getting no gifts for a while, is Christmas coming?
I'm a good boy on the track, no cussing
Please do not give me any more flak, I am struggling
I'm about to start crying in my bed, Evil Words spin around my head (Ha)
I'm going Trash Star crazy (Ha)
I'm Bladee, she call me Blade-e (Ha)
Angel or demon maybe (Ha)
I'm trying do what I can (Ha)
Can you please comprehend me?
Why can't you understand?
I'll shine some glory on your life (I don't know)
I am not anyone, I'm just some air inside the air
A piece of sand in all the sand, drop of water in the ocean
It may not seem that way, but I can promise you it's that
But enough of that, I'm coming back, I jump right back into the trash


[Chorus]
Walk on promised roads (Ha), I could take a joke (Haha)
Have you ever seen a ghost? (Ghost)
Pop out, pop out like a toast, you woke up late, the breakfast's closed
You know I don't brag (Brag) but I'm 'bout to boast (Ha)
Fabrics on my body (Yeah), it's designer probably (Sheesh)
Can't you see I'm litty? Rollin' like a trolley (Trolley)
Won't come to your party (Party) 'cause your friends are boring (Boring)
I'll be in the city (City), walking 'round like a tourist (Tourist)"
The Fool,,female/male,I Think...,"[Intro]
Dark outside (Yeah)
Uh-huh (Whatever)
Dark inside

[Chorus]
This is what I really want, it is, I think (Mmm)
You think it mattered so much to me but it didn't (Nah)
One day I am here, the next I'm gone, extinct (Extinct)
I've become so very small, I shrink, it is

[Bridge]
Pure love only, baby
Always is, always was
Make and break me, baby
Is this all, is this all I want

[Chorus]
Maybe I could be the one for you, I wish
I wish I could play the sport, I hit, I miss
But im coming back, of course you do, know this
I come out of the abyss but then I sink

[Verse]
Sink into the, into, into
Dark i fade, like love I fade away
One day I'm here, thе next I'm gone
I'm gone, away, that's tough
Pray, I pray for somеthing
I pray all night every day, I pray (Please God)
Was it all for nothing, nothing's all
I'm gone, away, dissolve



[Bridge]
So long (So long)
Overdue, the expiration date
Still stand tall
(But still ask for what)
Lift off, take away alot but there's still love
But for what? For what I forgot

[Chorus]
This is what I really want, it is, I think (Mmm)
You think it mattered so much to me but it didn't (Nah)
One day I am here, the next I'm gone, extinct (Extinct)
I've become so very small, I shrink, it is

[Bridge]
I know, I know, I know, I know
What goes up won't stay up
You find me, don't mind me
Love, love, love, sex and drugs

[Chorus]
At the end, it wasn't worth much, not a thing
The duality of life, uh-huh, that's it
Say you wanna have some fun, fuck it, I'm in
Might as well live in a cage you take my wings


[Outro]
She cut my wings off, baby
Take and take, give give our love
Sunset, sunset me, baby
Give me up, God is love"
The Fool,,female/male,Thee 9 Is Up,"[Intro]
Do you still fancy me?
Answer me
What will you do if I find someone else?
You're lying
(Whatever)

[Chorus]
Told bro, ""Let's rock""
We gon' climb up and get shieldy at the top
The bliss dont stop
I'm not Christian but I'm busting down the cross (Bust down)
The shield gon' lock
We put gates up and we double up on guards
The 9 is up
Work the wizard ways, I'm punching in the clock (Pew)

[Verse]
Greatness for us
If you believe in luck
Trust the sacred
Oh, just a touch, it's not enough
A place beyond the lust and temptations of love
Complete annihilation of us
Walk in light, see with anothеr eye
SG, we fortifiеd
I've been down bad trying to get back up
Had to make it worse, even more so
So, when I'm at my lowest, there's no other way
I'd only go up, I hope it's so
Fear of death and stress causes stress and fear of death
I can't lie, I must confess
Fear of death and stress causes stress and fear of death
I'm tryna see it as a test
I'm praying to God, please god may you bless me (Please God)
Still the same me but, baby, lately I've been messy
I must forgive myself before you can even forgive me
The shell is pretty, the Devil's busy
Oh, looks desperately for a sign, it's trials and tribulation time
The brave attempt fails and falls flat, he tries to take everything back
He's sure that something will go wrong, and that makes everything go wrong
But still the hope it's strong (The road is long you must go on)

[Bridge]
(Your love, your love, your love)
I'm falling twice every time, I just take a look in your eyes
(Your love, your love, your love)
In your arms, I'm a child, in your arms
(Your love, your love, your love)
I'm falling twice every time, I just take a look in your eyes
(Your love, your love, your love)
Takes me up, lifts me up

[Chorus]
Told bro, ""Let's rock""
We gon' climb up and get shieldy at the top, hahaha
The 9 is up
Work the wizard ways, I'm punching in the clock (Pew)
The shield got locks
We put gates up and we double up on guards

Boogie Naipe,,male,Sinta-se Bem Com O Boogie Naipe (Ft. Wilson Simoninha),"[Locução: Wilson Simoninha]
Boa noite, boa noite
Sejam bem-vindos
Hoje é dia de festa
Hoje é o nosso dia
Poesia e música
Coração e mentes
Sinta-se bem
Com o Boogie Naipe"
Boogie Naipe,,male,Gangsta Boogie (Ft. Lino Krizz),"[Introdução: Lino Krizz]
Fale de mim
Pra você
Mas o melhor que eu pude fazer
Se errei é só me dizer
O que tiver que ser
Tudo que eu preciso saber

Fiz um boogie pra você, baby
Fiz um boogie pra você entender

Mas se você não vem
(Falei pra ela)
Mas se você não vem

[Verso: Mano Brown]
Bola um, companheiro, mas que dia de cão
Nessa porra, sei não o que seu truta precisa
Aquela filha de uma... roubou minha brisa
Usou, me atacou, ó, o laço agora é nó
E eu me sinto pior, meu truta
Meu mal estar, meu caos particular
Mente já confusa, na menor me acusa
O que o malandro não usa e nem diz
Juras de revolta fiz, uma cruz em giz
Falei pra ela:
Se um dia fui, já não sou um exemplo, foi mal
Desgaste natural desse tempo, eu sei
De manhã, a fome com insônia é pânico
Além do normal, meu mau humor crônico
Longe do lar, a luto das ruas
Várias horas no ar, tô há 72
Minha sina é briga, intriga da oposição
Vamo à luta, ladrão
Gente nossa me grita, ouvi vozes aflitas
Tenho que ir e ir e ir
Pelo amor, pelo ego e ver multiplicar
Não me entrego, crioulo, eu sou zica
Porque a cena é hostil, tento me manter alto
Falei pra ela
Comprei sapato de salto, te trouxe colar
Não pergunte nem julgue de onde vem, vem buscar
Nessa noite, ó
Falei pra ela

Boogie Naipe,,male,Mal de Amor (Ft. Ellen Oléria & Lino Krizz),"[Refrão: Ellen Oléria & Lino Krizz]
Eu te avisei
Mas não quis me ouvir
Deixou eu morrer
Uma hora assim
Eu vou renascer
Gostar mais de mim
Sofrer é de lei
Tudo tem um fim

Pra não morrer de um mal de amor
Um outro dia, um novo amor
Para me curar

[Verso: Mano Brown]
Violento é o amor
Hoje eu peço paz
Agora quem não quer sou eu, não
Não quero mais
Lará-laiá-laiá
Nada do que foi será
Pois tudo passa
Tudo passará
Quem levou a pior fui eu
Um dia fomos um só
Pensei
Que jogo louco é o amor
Quem ama sai perdedor
No submundo onde estou
Pode pá, eu vou voltar
(Preciso fumar)

Sozinho na multidão
Boa noite, São Paulo
Não me convidou pra festa
Ferido no coração
Ser feliz, eu tenho pressa

Com uma ligação decide

Embutidos nesse clima
Só queria estar com você

Rastreando seu perfume divi
Você e seus amigos
Nesse chão
Sei que eu [?]

Eu te proponho
Meu jardim secreto
A casa dos meus sonhos
Matriz do meu lugar
Raiz onde você poderia nadar
Sem lenda, sem vento
Eu pensei te levar
Eu componho uma trilha
Te ponho no trilho
Te pego, te faço um filho
Eu te daria o céu, meu bem
Se você merecesse
Noite dessas, dia desses
Chuvosas de outono
Eu posso ser seu macho
E ser seu dono
Posso ser o que você quiser

Aí se ele me zuar tá fodido)

Então pelo amor
Nem tenta, morô"

Ela invade a pista e ninguém se mexe

Quer amar, quer beijar, quer se divertir
Ela manda, ela pode, ela é quem faz
Ela é funk, ela é samba, ela é mais, mais mais
Ela é Dolce & Gabbana, ela é Louis Vuitton
Ela é Madureira, ela é Kingston
Ela é Barra Funda, ela é Bela Vista

Ela é um hora e meia em frente ao espelho

Ela compra, ela bebe e malandro paga

Ela é as 10 mais da Billboard
Ela é Capão Redondo, ela é Xerém
Ela é blacking loving, ela é Soul Train
Ela é poucas palavras, talvez já viveu
Já sofreu o sistema na pele
É ZN, ZS ou ZO
Baixada santista, ABC ou ZL
Podia me aproximar


Ela opera a festa, ela é quem comanda
E a minha comanda quase preencheu
Mas se ela vier, valeu
Ô, entendeu

Vendo muleque, ela foi capaz
De entrar no banheiro e não voltar mais

But I'm washed up, redrum, sittin in 22's
Princess cut lightin up my Japanese tattoos

Ghetto bred pitbull, I ain't scared to scratch
I'm out the gate, po eight, 'cause I don't give a damn
HPD be lookin at me like my name was Gary Graham
Watch my trunk slam and my crack fool, nigga ride wit a fo fo
Bout to decide to shit you, viewed the loop
Sound the news, all these niggas been hatin on us
Big blue lights, lookin tight, twinkle the ice
He's ready to bust, switched it up, ounce up

Three deep screaming, ""S-U-C""
Haters better not 'plex wit me, I bet you can't get next to me
On my toes, orange juice and ecstasy
They try to make me lose my mind
Fuck around and make me use my nine
That's why I gotta take a cruise up town
Playa hatas jockin me just because I'm starched down
Ballin out of control and my AC blow cold

Yandhi Is King,,male,Selah,"[Verse 1: Kanye West]
God is King, we the soldiers
Ultrabeam out the solar
When I get to Heaven's gates
I ain’t gotta peek over
Keepin' perfect composure
When I scream at the chauffeur
I ain't mean, I’m just focused
I ain't mean, I'm just focused
Pour the lean out slower
Got us clean out of soda
Before the flood, people judge
They did the same thing to Noah
Everybody wanted Yandhi
Then Jesus Christ did the laundry
They say the week start on Monday
But the strong start on Sunday
Won't be in bondage to any man
John 8:33
We the descendants of Abraham
Ye should be made free
John 8:36
To whom the son set free is free indeed
He saved a wretch like me

[Chorus: Sunday Service Choir]
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, He is wonderful

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
If you woke, then wake up
With Judas, kiss and make up
Even with the bitter cup
Forgave my brothers and drank up
Did everything but gave up
Stab my back, I can't front
Still we win, we prayed up
Even when we die, we raise up (Hallelujah)
Ain't no wantin', no, we need it
The powers that be done been greedy
We need ours by this evening
No white flag or no treaty
We got the product, we got the tools
We got the minds, we got the youth
We goin' wild, we on the loose
People is lying, we are the truth
Everything old shall now become new
The leaves’ll be green, bearing the fruit
Love God and our neighbor, as written in Luke
The army of God and we are the truth

[Outro: Kanye West]
Wah, woo, wah, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo
Wah, woo, wah, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo

Yandhi Is King,,male,Follow God,"[Intro]
Father, I stretch
Stretch my hands to You

[Verse]
Lifelike, this is what your life like, try to live your life right
People really know you, push your buttons like typewrite
This is like a movie, but it's really very lifelike
Every single night, right, every single fight, right?
I was looking at the 'Gram and I don't even like likes
I was screamin' at my dad, he told me, ""It ain't Christ-like""
I was screamin' at the referee just like Mike
Lookin' for a bright light, Sigel, what your life like
Riding on a white bike, feeling like Excitebike (Stretch my hands to You)
Pressin' on the gas, supernova for a night light
Screamin' at my dad and he told me, ""It ain't Christ-like""
But nobody never tell you when you're being like Christ
Only ever seein' me only when they needin' me
Like if Tyler Perry made a movie for BET
Searchin' for a deity, now you wanna see it free
Now you wanna see if we, let's just see if three apiece
Tell me what your life like, turn it down, a bright light
Drivin' with my dad, and he told me, ""It ain't Christ-like"" (Stretch my hands to You)
I'm just tryna find, l've been lookin' for a new way
I'm just really tryin' not to really do the fool way
I don't have a cool way, bein' on my best, though
Block 'em on the text though, nothin' else next though
Not another word, letter, picture, or a decimal (Father, I stretch)
Wrestlin' with God, I don't really want to wrestle
Man, it's really lifelike, everything in my life (Stretch my hands to You)
Arguing with my dad, and he said, ""It ain't Christ-like""

[Outro]
Man
You know, it's like
Somebody only close who can get you, like, off your
I be on my
I woke up this morning, I said my prayers
I'm all doing good, I tried to talk to my dad (Stretch my hands to You)
Give him some advice, he starts spazzin' on me
I start spazzin' back, He said ""That ain't Christ-like""
I said, ""Ahhh"""
Yandhi Is King,,male,Closed on Sunday,"[Chorus]
Closed on Sunday, you're my Chick-fil-A
Closed on Sunday, you my Chick-fil-A
Hold the selfies, put the 'Gram away
Get your family, y'all hold hands and pray
When you got daughters, always keep 'em safe
Watch out for vipers, don't let them indoctrinate
Closed on Sunday, you my Chick-fil-A
You're my number one, with the lemonade
Raise our sons, train them in the faith
Through temptations, make sure they're wide awake
Follow Jesus, listen and obey
No more livin' for the culture, we nobody's slave

[Verse]
Stand up for my home
Even if I take this walk alone
I bow down to the King upon the throne
My life is His, I'm no longer my own
I pray to God that He'll strengthen my hand
They will think twice steppin' onto my land
I draw the line, it's written in the sand
Try me and you will see that I ain't playin'
Now, back up off my family, move your hands
I got my weapons in the spirit's land
I, Jezebel don't even stand a chance
Jezebel don't even stand a chance

Yandhi Is King,,male,On God,"[Intro]
Yo, Pi'erre, yo, Pi'erre

[Verse]
""How you get so much favor on your side?""
""Accept Him as your Lord and Saviour,"" I replied
Thou shalt love thy neighbor, not divide
I'ma ride, that's on God
His light shine the brightest in the dark
Single mothers know they got my heart
And all my brothers locked up on the yard
You can still be anything you wanna be
Went from one in four to one in three
Thirteenth amendment, gotta end it, that's on me
He the new commander and the chief
That's on Keef, that's on God
Before the ranch, I had horses in the garage
When the Forbes cover was just a mirage
They had me chasin' statues, that's on pride
""Oh my God,"" Bust said that's on Tribe
When I thought the Book of Job was a job
The Devil had my soul, I can't lie
Life gon' have some lows and some highs
Before the Grammy's ever gave a nod
I wore my heart on my sleeve, I couldn't hide
In '03, they told me not to drive
I bleached my hair for every time I could've died
But I survived, that's on God
I've been tellin' y'all since '05
The greatest artist restin' or alive
That's on L.A. Reid, that's on Clive
That's no Jive, that's on God
Off the 350s He supplied
The IRS want they fifty plus our tithe
Man, that's over half of the pie
I felt dry, that's on God
That's why I charge the prices that I charge
I can't be out here dancin' with the stars
No, I cannot let my family starve
I go hard, that's on God

[Outro]
(Yo Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?)
Okay, okay, okay, okay"

So I ball so hard, motherfuckers wanna fine me
But first niggas gotta find me
What's fifty grand to a motherfucker like me? Can you please remind me?
(Ball so hard) This shit crazy
Y'all don't know that don't shit faze me

And I'd look at you like this shit gravy

It's only right that we'd be fair
Psycho, I'm liable to go Michael, take your pick

Rollies that don't tick-tock
Audemars that's losing time
Hidden behind all these big rocks
(B-ball so hard) I'm shocked too
I'm supposed to be locked up too
You escaped what I escaped
You'd be in Paris getting fucked up too
(B-ball so hard) Let's get faded
Le Meurice for like six days
Gold bottles, scold models
Spillin' Ace on my sick J's
(Ball so hard) Bitch, behave
Just might let you meet Ye
Chi-Town's D. Rose
I'm moving the Nets, BK

She said, ""Ye, can we get married at the mall?""
I said, ""Look, you need to crawl 'fore you ball""
Come and meet me in the bathroom stall
And show me why you deserve to have it all
(Ball so hard) That shit cray, ain't it, Jay?
(B-ball so hard) What she order, fish fillet?
(B-ball so hard) Your whip so cold, this old thing?
(Ball so hard) Act like you'll ever be around motherfuckers like this again
Bougie girl, grab her hand
Fuck that bitch, she don't wanna dance
Excuse my French, but I'm in France, ahah, I'm just sayin'
Prince Williams ain't do it right, if you ask me
'Cause I was him, I would have married Kate and Ashley
What's Gucci, my nigga? What's Louis, my killer?
What's drugs, my dealer? What's that jacket, Margiela?
Doctors say I'm the illest 'cause I'm suffering from realness
Got my niggas in Paris and they going gorillas, huh

[Interlude]
I don't even know what that means
No one knows what it means, but it's provocative
No, it's not, it's gross
Gets the people going


[Chorus: JAY-Z]
Ball so hard, motherfuckers wanna fine me
B-ball so hard, motherfuckers wanna fine me

[Outro: Kanye West, JAY-Z & Both]
You are now watching the throne
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
These other niggas is lyin'
Actin' like the summer ain't mine
(I got that hot bitch in my home)
You know how many hot bitches I own?
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
The stars is in the building
They hands is to the ceiling
I know I'm 'bout to kill it
How you know? I got that feeling
You are now watching the throne
Don't let me into my zone
Don't let me into my zone
(I'm definitely in my zone)

Oh, just another lonely night
Are you willing to sacrifice your life?

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Bitch, I'm a monster, no-good bloodsucker
Fat motherfucker, now look who's in trouble
As you run through my jungles, all you hear is rumbles
Kanye West samples, here's one for example

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga, I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Uh, the best living or dead hands down, huh
Less talk, more head right now, huh
And my eyes more red than the devil is
And I'm 'bout to take it to another level, bitch
Matter who you go and get, ain't nobody cold as this
Do the rap and the track, triple-double, no assists
And my only focus is stayin' on some bogus shit
Arguin' with my older bitch, actin' like I owe her shit
I heard the beat, the same raps that gave the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fucking up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane
Chi nigga, but these hoes love my accent
Chick came up to me and said, ""This the number to dial
If you wanna make your number one your number two now""
Mix that Goose and Malibu, I call it ""Malibooyah""
Goddamn, Yeezy always hit 'em with a new style
Know that motherfucker, well, what you gon' do now?
Whatever I wanna do, gosh, it's cool now
Know I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now
Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out
'Cause you'll never get on top of this
So, mami, best advice is just to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?
Ah, put the pussy in a sarcophagus
Now she claiming that I bruised her esophagus
Head of the class and she just won a swallowship
I'm livin' in the future so the present is my past
My presence is a present, kiss my ass

Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert

Sasquatch, Godzilla, King Kong, Loch Ness
Goblin, ghoul, a zombie with no conscience
Question, what do these things all have in common?
Everybody knows I'm a motherfuckin' monster
Conquer, stomp ya, stop your silly nonsense
Nonsense, none of you niggas know where the swamp is
None of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen
I still hear fiends scream in my dreams
Murder, murder in black convertibles, I
Kill a block, I murder the avenues, I
Rape and pillage your village, women and children
Everybody want to know what my Achilles heel is
Love, I don't get enough of it
All I get is these vampires and bloodsuckers
All I see is these niggas I made millionaires
Millin' about, spillin' they feelings in the air
All I see is these fake fucks with no fangs
Tryna draw blood from my ice-cold veins
I smell a massacre
Seems to be the only way to back you bastards up

Pull up in the monster, automobile gangsta
With a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka
Yeah, I'm in that Tonka, color of Willy Wonka
You could be the king, but watch the queen conquer
Okay, first things first, I'll eat your brains
Then I'ma start rocking gold teeth and fangs
'Cause that's what a motherfuckin' monster do
Hair dresser from Milan, that's the monster 'do
Monster Giuseppe heel, that's the monster shoe
Young Money is the roster and a monster crew
And I'm all up, all up, all up in the bank with the funny face
And if I'm fake, I ain't notice 'cause my money ain't
So let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie?
But my features and my shows ten times your pay?
50K for a verse, no album out
Yeah, my money's so tall that my Barbies got to climb it
Hotter than a Middle Eastern climate, violent
Tony Matterhorn, dutty wine it, wine it
Nicki on them titties when I sign it
That's how these niggas so one-track-minded
But really, really I don't give an F-U-C-K
""Forget Barbie, fuck Nicki, sh-she's fake""
""She on a diet,"" but my pockets eatin' cheesecake
And I'll say, bride of Chucky, it's child's play
Just killed another career, it's a mild day
Besides, Ye, they can't stand besides me
I think me, you, and Am' should ménage Friday
Pink wig, thick ass, give 'em whiplash
I think big, get cash, make 'em blink fast
Now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for
Ah, I'm a motherfuckin' monster


[Outro: Justin Vernon & Charlie Wilson]
I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home (Headed home)
I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide, 'cide (No)
And I, I wouldn't last these shows

Foot on the Devil's neck 'til it drifted Pangaea

Now they wanna hit me with the woo wap, the bam
Tryna snap photos of familia
My daughter look just like Sia, you can't see her
You can feel the lyrics, the spirit coming in braille
Tubman of the underground, come and follow the trail
I made “Sunday Candy,” I'm never going to hell
I met Kanye West, I'm never going to fail
He said, ""Let's do a good ass job with 'Chance 3'""
I hear you gotta sell it to snatch the Grammy
Let's make it so free and the bars so hard
That there ain't one gosh darn part you can't tweet
This is my part, nobody else speak
This is my part, nobody else speak
This little light of mine
Glory be to God, yeah
I'ma make sure that they go where they can't go
If they don't wanna ride, I'ma still give 'em raincoats
Know what God said when He made the first rainbow
Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro
Ugh, I'm just having fun with it
You know that a nigga was lost
I laugh in my head
'Cause I bet that my ex looking back like a pillar of salt
Ugh, 'cause they'll flip the script on your ass like Wesley and Spike
You cannot mess with the light
Look at lil' Chano from 79th

Rodeo,,male,Pornography,"[Intro: T.I.]
Nine light years away, just outside of the Kepler solar system
We find ourselves consumed and utterly mesmerized
With a story of a young rebel against the system
Refusing to conform or comply to the ways of authority
He chose the mood of ""Fuck this shit""
At that moment, the one known as Jacques turned to Scott
Chose to jump off his mama porch leading the stampede of lost souls
In the middle of their metamorphosis, not quite through with their journey
Ain't made it to wherever the fuck they gon' be in life
But wherever it is, it's better than here, so fuck you, and fuck this

[Chorus]
No monogamy, ménage with me
Pornography surrounding me
You get high with me, you come down with me
That's all I need in my fantasy
All these flashing lights—, lights—, lights—
Give you some of me, you want all of me
And get high with me and come down with me
Yeah, that's all I need in my fantasy

[Verse 1]
You remind me of my ex, crazy love
We designed our love around the drugs
We both in this club, we both tryna fuck
I'ma rub a dub, tryna get a nut


[Chorus]
No monogamy, ménage with me
Pornography surrounding me
You get high with me, you come down with me
That's all I need in my fantasy
All these flashing lights blinding me
Give you some of me, you want all of me
And get high with me and come down with me
Yeah, that's all I need in my fantasy

[Interlude: T.I.]
The story of the bastard was never told
The soul of a bastard was never sold
Will he survive, or will he fold up?
Living like a bronco, lifestyle wild and untamed
Sit sip at the top, a long list of no named
Misfits can't wait to get a chance to say ""Fuck you""
To the ones who say ""Fuck you""
'Til you doing ya thing, codeine and cocaine cartels
Who leads the charge of this young mob?
La Flame, he hears in his head, ""The world is yours"" (Yours, yours)

[Refrain]
Wake up, nigga, gotta get the cake up, nigga
Niggas in the bushes in the farms, might gotta rake up a nigga
I'm way too antsy 'cause my ambition's too frantic
I might need to move to Atlantis 'cause my mind too outlandish

[Verse 2]
It's the rodeo, time to get started
Houston nigga goin' James Harden
They was wildin' on us niggas in the projects
Wonder why a nigga went cold-hearted
They wanna put my soul up on an auction
But I'ma make 'em take the fall like August
And they gon' vote me right in on my caucus
And I'ma show these niggas how to get lawless
Why your hands out, asking could you hold one?
Who do I owe? Nigga, no one
They bigging you up but you low down
Animated acting frozen
I got porno pics, wish I can post them
Stackin' Franklins, I can't fold 'em
Niggas askin' for the old him
But I'm way too young to be the old him
I'ma make this shit crack Lamar Odom
'Til I climb to the top of the podium

[Refrain]
So wake up, nigga, gotta get the cake up, nigga
Niggas in the bushes, niggas on the farm, might gotta rake up a nigga
I'm way too antsy 'cause my ambition's too frantic
I might move out to Atlantis 'cause my mind too outlandish

Wasted or nah?
(Aw, aw, yeah, aw)
Are you wasted or nah? Wasted or nah? Wasted or nah?

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Take a sip, drowning in this shit, coppers on my hip, I hold my head
I've been taking risks to make that money flip, shots to the head
I ain't order it, I can't afford this shit
Go to war with this you overboard, I'm over bored with shit
Now, it's pay up player, pay a nigga
Gotta day to day to stack and still I pay accountants
Twenty racks to show just a little allowance
Only come to Houston if the boy allow it
Bow your head to a real one, coming down with them main niggas
H-Town, don't play with us, them wit-it boys stay wit-wit-wit it
I've been grinding, slaving over time since I was a fan
Looking in the mirror like ""One day, Jacques, you gon' be the man""
One skinny, tatted nigga, blunt flicker
Young La Flame, hot spitter who can't hold his liquor, yah

[Chorus: Pimp C]
It's really going down in the goddamn south
I'm trill, I'm country 'til the end
It-it-i-it's really going down in the goddamn south
I'm trill, I'm country 'til the end


[Interlude: Juicy J & Travis Scott]
There's a lot of motherfuckers that can't handle they liquor
Can't handle these drugs
Wasted or nah?
It's only real niggas that can handle their shit, man
Wasted or nah?
Yeah (Wasted or nah?)
So, if you tryna get lit, wanna pour up?
Make sure you stay on our level, 'cause we go up
Let me see you up

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Is you wasted, baby?
One shot, two shots and you still talking crazy (Trippy)
Three shots and you faded
Freaks coming out at night and they gettin' X rated
Four shots now she wanna do the clique
Any more shots she ain't gon' remember shit
Smoking on extendos, no clips
Project hoes going up in the Ritz (Trippy)
She gon' do it for a G, anything for me, bruh
She just wanna fuck and drink and chief all the weed up
Sexy bitch, pop that pussy 'cause you in your prime
Pour that purple over ice, call it ""turtle time""
Shawty never been a hesitator
Got her going down on the elevator
Heard the pussy bomb, I'ma detonate her
Fuck her from the back, keep the neck for later
No magic trick, but I levitate her
With the magic stick, nothing less than great
When I hit her with the dope D, I'm gone
Don't text me later, no extra favors
[Chorus: Pimp C]
It's really going down in the goddamn south
I'm trill, I'm country 'til the end
It-it-i-it's really going down in the goddamn south
I'm trill, I'm country 'til the end

[Outro: T.I.]
Hmm, weed, lean, MDMA, he say, she say
All the products of a young man gone the long way
From the home that he knew, 'til he roamed where he at
And the phone break up, unknown wake up
Several one night stands, hung up phone, break up
If he fall, will he fly? Sure, wouldn't take much
For you to find out, jump, if you took that plunge
If not, we're in the same spot, how could you judge?
How could you judge? C-c-could you judge?"

Whole crew, I swear they counting on me
Gold chains, gold rings, I got an island on me
Houses on me, he got them ounces on him
Holy Father, come save these niggas, I'm styling on 'em
Good Lord, I see my good fortune in all these horses

[Verse]
Gorgeous beautiful taboo, always with a lot on her mind
You giving me all of your stories in the littlest amount of time
You loving me is forbidden, loving you back is a crime
I wrote this poem for you, forever remain in my rhymes
I knew you wasn't normal ever since the age of nine
I, heard you were molested when you hit the age of five
So, in a sense I sensed that all your innocence had died
You, swallowing all of your pride, won't, let anybody inside
As you cry me a thousand lakes on my shoulder blade, I say
Everything's gonna be okay
I'ma hold tight 'til I see the next day with you
Stay with you, play with you, pray with you and pray to you
Curry killed the pussy hoping that I could kill the hate in you
Even if you don't wait for me, forever I will wait for you
Even if it's too late for me, forever I will wait for you
Watching your destiny fold in the grip of my palms
Paper planes being thrown on the side of the lawn, it said

[Chorus]
Welcome to the darker side of TA13OO
All I've got is permanent scars and tattoos
Take another step in the path that you choose
Make a bad choice in your path then you lose
Welcome to the darker side of TA13OO
All I've got is permanent scars and tattoos
Take another step in your path that you choose
Make a bad choice in your path then you lose

Hot pink, Valentine red
Black balloons, over my head
Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float
Let it float, let it float by me
Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float
Let it float, let it float by me

[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
Inside this paper plane
Note my words are Navy sealed so here and I quote
Taboo and I are in the same boat
What's said from Pennywise, I guess we all float
Sky is the limit, I could die in a minute
Got my mind in a skillet, suicide not a mission
See the vibe very timid, I'm timid and very sad
Translated my thoughts and feelings, I pivot into the pad
Rapers turn to landscapers when they use hoes
Hoes turn to housewives when they see gold
Ice Cube with activator when I'm aggravated
Or decapitated when I lose my head since life is overrated
Two thousand feet, a thousand steps
I let it all sink to one thousand depths
Soon black balloons pop
Let it be the day the pain stop


[Chorus: Denzel Curry & Twelve'len]
Hot pink, Valentine red
Black balloons, over my head
Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float
Let it float, let it float by me
Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float
Let it float, let it float by me
Hot pink, Valentine red
Black balloons, over my head
Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float
Let it float, let it float by me
Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float
Let it float, let it float by me

[Verse 2: GoldLink]
Heaven or Hell, huh, which one prevails, huh?
We gotta go and figure it out
I tried to tell you that this life isn't it
And I just wanna be the rightest I can be
Show my son to think so he can fly as high can be
Always show examples how they kill niggas like me
Thinking as straight as me, but call me crazy
Sun is my attitude, so I'm cool like JAY-Z
Ándale, ándale, my intelligence for threes
Cancel me like I ain't the King of D.C
Cancel me like I ain't the number one G
Cancel me like you don't like ""Dance On Me""
Quickly they forget how you change on all these lies
You flashing all these lights, and you savin' these kids lives
And they hate you 'cause you're right, give me hell then, shit
Take your turn to fire and to pitchfork, bitch


[Chorus: Denzel Curry & Twelve'len]
Hot pink, Valentine red
Black balloons, over my head
Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float
Let it float, let it float by me
Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float
Let it float, let it float by me
Hot pink, Valentine red
Black balloons, over my head
Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float
Let it float, let it float by me
Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float
Let it float, let it float by me

Tonight on 102.1, it's Denny Cascade and the gang in town
Denzel, are you really making an album?
I'm telling you, eventually, they're gonna catch up to your game, you're running out of time!
Someone is really trying to hurt me!
It's not enough is it? It's not enough you had us come out here
In the middle of the night
What exactly are you trying to hide, Mr. Curry?

Imperial,,male,ULT,"[Verse 1]
This is the wrath of Aquarius
I am the black metal terrorist, ain't no comparison
Humanitarian, bitch, I'm a veteran
Better than anyone comprehend
Snake in the grass, cut the copperhead
Hollow tips point at a copper head
Drop a head, poppin' the Glock 'til the copper dead
But Bishop killed Radames
That is the biggest hypocrisy
I don't see nobody stopping me
Bro, your whole life is a mockery
A militant, mind on a million
Civilian, I am the realest, bitch
No Gilligan, put me on an island
Smoking on an island 'til a nigga look Thailand
Spread through your crew like a motherfucking virus
Cloud 9 confederate, breaking up barriers
Federation in your area
If I'm a bitch, then I guess you a pussy, and pussies are scared of a terrier, woof
Run all your paper, killer Curry keep on catching the caper
Dominating, common denominator
Aftermath, you can just do the math later, as a teenager
I was an underdog under the Raiders, valuable player
Young Bo Jackson slammin' packs with a passion
Satisfaction with the lack of compassion
It's a maverick hella gaspin', but actually
I am that nigga entirely
The same ones that inspire me be the same ones that wanna retire me, nigga

In the night time, keep me out of sight, it's the poltergeist
When I'm ghost, I'ma cut the line, now you outta mind

Mystical miracle, I build imperial
I'm analytical, why Lotto had to be off to the clinical
Now we're identical, black individual, no biochemical, serve
Fuck the cops, they the opposition
And these halfway niggas and these halfway hoes
Wanna be buddy-buddy, they see you at a show
But be the main ones that be hating on the low
Wait, that's just irrelevant
They got the fact when you look at my melanin, woah
Cops killin' niggas, niggas killin' brothas, niggas hate each other, don't know
Where the fuck they came from, we the ones that paid dues
I don't watch Fox News, don't mean that all my foxes sly
Find a little white girl, but let you die
Gun like a veteran, breakin' off barriers, they just might call me a terrorist
Rather get caught with it than without it, if I keep it concealed when I carry it, I
Put them on paper
Send them to prison and give them free labor
Separate everyone, make sure they neighbors
Aftermath, after that, we can laugh later
Fuck all my haters
I raise a Black fist as black as the Raiders
Home of the Gators
Federation is my organization
All relation, no religion, no races
Black to Asian, we the nation of U.L.T.
True to you, so keep it true to me
Haters cannot put an end to me because I truly know who is my enemy, nigga

But the way I rap had niggas fooled
Yeah, I'm a gook, niggas started skipping school, me and Monty and Raul
Hopping the fence by Carol City park
Fuck the next class bitch I'm already smart

But how this gook, ended up surpassing you?
Why you looking confused?
Made a hard album so what can you do?
I'm the Gook Runner, the Imperial
Shout out to Mook, that be my flesh
Niggas can't fathom that I am the best
I gave you threatz, ultimate next
Shoutout the Klan because that’s on the set
Fucking with me I will put you to rest
Lie and you’ll remember to speak with your chest
Gooking forever I'm still at your neck
Bitch I'm gooking forever so give me respect, bitch!

Jabbie told me we gon blow up like land mines
I don't fuck with purp, that's the only reason Yams died

But I bet you I can even keep it 10 times better than you
I'm a gook!
Jabbie told me we gon blow up like a land mine

Put him in his spot, nigga, run the bread

Posted sellin' green so not no mo’, cause a nigga is tired of being broke
And I’m tired of living off my folks
My old girl need some help
And my girlfriend bout to have a jit
Plus I don’t want him growing up saying that he never had shit
That he never had it but based on analysis
I never seen challenges, I look at his Roley I know that he flashin' it
I wouldn't mind seeing blood just like I got off dialysis Lord of the dark and violent
Only know imperial niggas move in silence, look that old boy yeah you shining
Steve got gold, and his girl got diamonds
Hopping in the whip, 2 niggas riding
We all gon die nigga fuck reclining, we all got 5 lets get behind em
Let's go get em

Who’s that peeking in my window?
Baby, please pass the extendo
Hey yo, they tryna take my cheese and my steelo
Two 44s at your head, don’t be a hero
I said who’s that peeking in my window?
Baby, please pass the extendo
Hey yo, they tryna take my cheese and my steelo
Two 44s at your head, don’t be a hero

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]
I been seeing, watching cause these niggas got it in for me
Flexing flashy wrists is correlating with my golden teeth
Diamonds all around a neck and it came with a diamond ring
I done seen all kind of shit, what niggas do over finer things
That’s why I carry the nine on me that’s a three times three extendo, that’s a 10-4
Seen them niggas on the 191, but a nigga peep game on the 194
Woah, bending corners just to see if they followed us
Sweating bullets, heater under my cardigan
These type of niggas is known to be poppin' shit
Deep in my thoughts, know who the prophet is
Tryna to take my wealth gotta protect my wifey and my jit
Gotta set an example if you thinkin' I'm a walking lick
Never believed in lawlessness, but I could be with the shits
When I’m nervous it's dangerous, if the police pull up then I tell em I’m innocent
They tried to run down on us, pulled out the clip then I empty it
Lords of the dark and violent, just ended up on the pavement, quiet
This is the reason why niggas divided, pray to the lord I don’t get indicted
Send me all the way to Rikers Island, dead on the ground now he’s a carcass
That’s our guy, nigga, that’s our target
Let’s go get em


[Chorus: Denzel Curry]
Who’s that peeking in my window?
Baby, please pass the extendo
Hey yo, they tryna take my cheese and my steelo
Two 44s at your head, don’t be a hero
I said who’s that peeking in my window?
Baby, please pass the extendo
Hey yo, they tryna take my cheese and my steelo
Two 44s at your head, don’t be a hero

Sub-zero, put a nigga on salt, iced out
This the price I gotta pay because I wanna be iced out
Have them lookin' at my face as they tellin' me lights out
Sleep is the cause of the death, no a NY not my state of mind

Gem golds in my mouth and my dreads lookin' like a palm-tree

Get the product then we out the door
Mama I've been twistin' weed
And now it's time to lock the fro, let it go
Call me knotty head and if I ever go
Tell my mama that I love her cause tomorrow not for sure
I would never know


[Chorus: Denzel Curry]
Tote a 4 and pour some liq'
I'ma tote that stick until they send me to the pen
This the way it is, I gotta get it how I live
Knotty headed niggas
Tote a 4 and pour some liq'
I'ma tote that stick until they send me to the pen
This the way it is, I gotta get it how I live

Hatin' on his dawg, shit I’m tryna find mine (Woo)
Calm nigga, when I’m lit up I get Von Miller (Huh)
Rich niggas, if you real then you can run with us (Let's get it)
Educated reading books, I’m talkin Art of War
Whippin yoda yayo residue on the marble floors
I wanna see my niggas with the flyest clothes (Woo)
Came to put my city on that’s if I’m right or wrong (What?)
Pulling into Risco Park in the richest cars (Woo)
And I’m thinking of my dawgs since I’m livin wrong
Jehovah’s witness, swear to God I done seen it all (Bang)
Picking up the pistols every time the dogs bark (ugh)
You pointing fingers but them choppers cutting arms off
D.C.C.C., we came to warn y'all

Why these crackers thinking that a nigga serve narcotics?
Just because I'm living doesn't mean a nigga got it

Ayy, smoking and twisting I'm black and I'm gifted
These crackers be thinkin' that niggas get wicked
Ferocious and vicious, they bust out and diss us
Imperial pistols that Narc on a mission
That's another nigga dead, hit 'em with the beam infrared
Frankly, I'm fed up with Feds
Profiling because my dreads long
Nigga that's Biggie, it's dead wrong
Head home, dro in the atmosphere
Wondering why they think a nigga selling narcotics
All because we niggas that be livin' in the projects
If I move funny ,they gon' hit me with the object
Objective is subject, watch kill (Uh)
Take you down if they know you got it
Brains in the street, they'll leave you thoughtless, damn

Why these crackers thinking that a nigga serve narcotics?

Nine on the side of my hip, bow
This the return of the black owl

Raven Miyagi is back, ow (Bow-bow-bow-bow)
Black metal fist got these other motherfuckers caught up in the mix
Put 'em in the bars when they didn't do shit
Got the opposition living on the offense
It's why I gotta grab my rifle
Think about survival, hand on the Bible, so
I won't let none of them take my soul
That's why a nigga stay on ten toes down

[Outro]
Why these niggas thinkin on the low that we got it?
Bitch, because I got it doesn't mean a nigga got it
Why these niggas thinkin on the low that we got it?
Thinkin' every nigga is selling narcotics
Why do I have a lot of arrests? Because of harassment. Why is there harassment? Because them people that harass me, have set up a problem that made me, disagree with them violently and, and they, they set up these problem, in order to exploit me and other people like me
They think they're living in a police state and they become hostile toward the policemen
And why they wanna get rid of me? Because I'm saying something that might wake up other exploited people and some depressed people and if all these people ever get together, then these pigs that are exploiting us we'll be able to run them into the lake. That's why they wanna get rid of us
I want when they see me, they know that every day when I'm breathing, it's-it's-it's for us to go farther, you know? Every time I speak, I want the truth to come out, you know what I'm sayin'? Every time I speak, I want to shiver, and even if I get in trouble you know what I'm sayin'? That, ain't that what we're supposed to do?"

Auf jeden Fall, ich war Papageiensiedlung und bin, äh, gelaufen und hab' dann aufm Parkhaus hinten geseh'n, wie er einfach oben drauf stand, so zehn Meter groß, ich schwör's dir, es ist, so dumm wie's klingt.

53 Zentimeter, vier verdammte Kilogramm
Mir fällt es schwer zu atmen, doch ein Engel kommt
Und hält mich in den Armen, solang bis ich schlafe wie ein Junk auf Codein
Ich wache auf in einer Wohnung, die bei weitem zu klein ist, um sich dort wohl zu fühl'n
Doch anscheinend groß genug ist, um dort ohne Flous zwei Kinder großzuzieh'n
Ich träume von roten Blüten, während ich in mei'm Hochbett lieg'
Denn Mama geht's nicht gut in diesen Zeiten
Baba geht's nicht besser, zum Verstecken ist die Bude viel zu klein
Deswegen halt' ich meiner Schwester die Ohren zu, wenn sie streiten
Ich lass' die Augen ruh'n und schlafe ein und werde wach in einem Klassenzimmer
Von dem lauten Lachen von achtzehn Kindern
Die mir mit ihren blassen Fingern durch die Locken streifen
Verschwind' aufs Klo, wo ich dann meine Tränen trocken reibe
Und mir schwör', den nächsten Pisser knock' ich einfach, fuck it
Die Einzige, die mich noch versteht, ist Michelle mit den gleichen Haaren
Kam vor 'nem Jahr aus den Staaten, ihr Vater ein Soldat
Sie sagte mir, „Zeig ihn'n niemals die weiße Fahne!“
Dreißig Tage später zieh'n wir weg, ich fühl' mich schlecht, dass sie alleine da ist
Ich bin dreizehn Jahre, mobben mit den Jungs
Jogginghosen, neue Hobbys, Alkopops und großer Mund
Keine Locken, sondern Stoppel, komm und trau dich, was zu sagen
Fick das Blaulicht, dieser Block gehört jetzt uns
Dimi sieht das ganze anders, er kommt an während der ersten großen Pause
Er nennt mich einen Nigga, deshalb färbe ich sein Auge
Kurz darauf schickt mich die Lehrerin nach Hause
Ich krieg' noch nicht mal Ärger von mei'm Vater, als er hört, warum ich rausflieg'
Sechzehn Jahre alt, ein Fuß in der Strafanstalt
Weiber, Alk und Gras sind mittlerweile intressanter als das Zeichnen oder Basketball
Und obendrein lässt mich auch jede weitere Phrase meines Vaters mich zu tadeln kalt
Ich bin siebzehn, klaue Autos mit mein'n Niggas
170 auf der Autobahn, Rauchschwaden aus dem Civic
Und fahr' ihn an 'ne Hauswand, falls die Blauen uns erwischen
Sag ihn'n, fuck it, ich bin down mit meinen Niggas, yeah"

Ich bin falsche Uhren, aber echte Heckler
Ich bin Ketten, Schraubenzieher, Teppichmesser

MAC-11s, Neuner TECs und Heckler feuern
Niggas ducken, Niggas rennen, Niggas sterben
Ich bin Schmerzen von gebrochenen Mütterherzen
Ich bin nicht der Hirte, ich bin nicht die Herde
Ich bin Metzger, Nigga, keine Rettung, ich bin die Vendetta, Nigga
Ihr seid nicht die Ersten, die nicht vierzig werden, ich bin trappen, Nigga, ah


[Outro]
Keine Bange, ich bin allein mit mein'n Gedanken
Meine Leute tanzen vor der Leiche von einem Polizeibeamten
Ich hab' keine Zeit für Angst, ich werde nicht fünfzig
Werf’ eine Münze, ganz egal, wie sie aufkommt, sie wird nie auf der richtigen Seite landen, ja"
Geist,,male/female,Siedlung,"[Songtext zu „Siedlung“]

[Part 1]
Hochhaus-Wohnkomplex, Großraum, Benz voller Straps
Zahltag, Bitch, Zahltag! (Bitch), Magnum fragt; „Wo ist dein Cash?“
Hol's raus, Bitch! Komm, und zwing mich nicht dazu, dich Ho dazu zu zwing'n
Blaue Scheine in 'nem Durag, Nigga
Guck, ich renne, als wär es ein Urinstinkt, ja
Marlboros, Lederjacke wie Indiana Jones
Mein Vater riet mir täglich dieses Leben ab
Aber ich sag', ich sterbe für mein Barrio
Nigga, ich trappe und schlafe erst spät (spät)
Häng' in der Siedlung mit Sahin und Leon
Erstes Young Jeezy-Album aus dem Radiogerät
Frag nach ihm für 'ne Nasen-OP

[Hook]
Ho, ich bin in der Siedlung, zwölf Stockwerke
Sechs Blocks plus mein Block und kein Cop in Sicht
Digga, ich bin in der Siedlung, zwölf Stockwerke
Sechs Blocks plus mein Block und kein Cop in Sicht

[Part 2]
Schick mich in die Hölle, Digga, komm' zurück und find' sie nur in Trümmern vor
Nigga droht mir mit 'nem Schwinger, ich geb' ihm zwei Ringer-Ohr'n
Bitch, ihr seid nicht mal 'ne Gang, denn ihr singt wie ein Kinderchor
Renne maskiert aus dem Hili-Store
Ho, denn ich bin überall, guck, die einzige Türe, die ich niemals betreten kann, ist das Himmelstor
Pausenhof, schwarzes Handy und die Augen rot (puh)
Stürm' den Penny, fick ein Hausverbot (fick es!)
Du willst hängen? Komm, und trau dich, Ho!
Sag, du willst hängen, denn hör auf zu zittern, Ho (Bitch)
Ich kann die Bitch in dir wittern, Ho (Bitch)
Ich rufe laut „Fick den Richter!“, denn ich bin ein 55127-Nigga, Ho

[Hook]
Du weißt, ich komm' aus der Siedlung, zwölf Stockwerke
Sechs Blocks plus mein Block und kein Cop in Sicht
Digga, ich bin in der Siedlung, zwölf Stockwerke

Digga, ich bin in der Siedlung, zwölf Stockwerke

Farelerle ahbap olmayı iyi ki de öğrendik, piyasa kaypak
Parasız kalmak insana çok şey öğretiyo' yok öyle tatmak
İstersin almak, istersin kaçmak sorunlardan ama olmaz

Contamos histórias dentro de boates
E são só questão de fases
Não dá pra apertar o pause (Porra, que merda)

Então, então, uma casa com escadas

O pai já não me escuta, então só neurose que sobra
Vou ir lá buscar as meninas, sair pra dar um rasante
A Duda ainda é pequena, o mundo ainda é gigante
Continuo reclamando lá na CPFL
O caminhão vem igual linha chilena no fio, já se passa das sete
Tudo escuro, só pra combinar comigo, dia frio
E a ira vem atrás igual cadela no cio, por quê?

Hm, veja bem, por impulso de alguns ou de alguém
Nessa novela das seis eu não fiz papel de refém
Ainda bem, é que eu te enxergo sempre em ré menor
Continuo ouvindo barulho, careta pra mim é pior
Não é diferente, com nós não é diferente
Entrar numas boate procurando umas bruxa pra dormir com a gente, sim
Moedas fazem escândalo, dólar é silencioso
Qual deles você acha que eu quero ter no meu bolso?
Igual pessoas em relacionamentos
Que transformam seu ego em água depois joga cimento por cima
A vida é um poema sujo, minha linda
E pena que ela vai com você, menina

Porque o seu olhar me enxerga de maneira equivocada
Se somos a faísca do incêndio, a insegurança, a água
Sua neurose é o bombeiro que vem e nos apaga
E ela acha que na rua da minha casa
Todas as mulheres caem de amor por mim
Que no estúdio tá chei' de mulher pelada
E fazem massagem com óleo na minha barba, tipo assim
Só que não, isso é coisa que não existe, em plena sexta-feira
Quase meia-noite, e eu em casa terminando um beat
Chegue mais perto, tenho um álbum pra lhe dar
Você pode não saber, mas sou eu que salvo o mundo, não é o mundo que vai me salvar

Acha que estou numa novela e eu que sou o galã
E é quase sempre assim, que feitiço fizeram pra mim?
Se acontece metade dessas ideias, eu já estava feliz
E até queria passear de mãos dadas a beira-mar
Mas corro risco do mundo me amar e se pá
Vão querer fotografar, leve uma caneta pr'eu usar
Nunca se sabe quem vai estar por lá
Se acalme um pouco, segure a emoção
Você sabe que saindo daqui é nós dois contra o mundão
Se perguntarem por mim, responda algo óbvio
Que eu fui atrás de uns lucros e já volto logo, logo

Convidado pra festas com pessoas discretas
Não há lugar pra ficar, não há lugar pra ficar

Vão saber o que eu faço à noite, de dia, à tarde
Na fila do pão não vão me deixar à vontade
Pensei, talvez, que ia dar pra controlar (Quando, quando)
Quando eu fosse comprar pastel não ia ter ninguém pra filmar
Resolvi estimular alguns instrumentais
Por que só agora sou original, se já tinha isso há muito tempo atrás?
Batata grande e cheddar derruba sorriso de paraquedas
No corre da moeda, pra imprimir umas moedas
E apesar de tudo, sigo almejando o espaço
E quando cantarem meu nome em suas músicas
O que que eu faço, que que eu faço?

Que tinha perdido o emprego há pouco
Tava pra nascer o filho mais novo

O porquê de eu estar aqui
Mantenha o foco no plano perfeito, Spike
Se Deus quiser, hoje não vai ter erro
Já errei botando Deus no meio
Olha o que vivemos e temos passado
Todos somos bem aventurados (Amém, irmão!)
Somos só filhos do pecado
Com os problemas do bairro
Com os problemas do mundo
Com os problemas casados
Pelos problemas caçados
Eu só queria sorrir, mas não sou rico
Não queria morrer, mas me sentir vivo

[Verso 2]
Deixa a firma como está
Não encoste na panela enquanto o Gang está
Ele prometeu que ia voltar
Por isso é diferente dos cara que já tem lá (Vai vendo)
E é melhor se acostumar
Em época de pedra, máquinas vão trabalhar
É coisa séria ou tinha algo na plateia
Por isso a minha cara não estava no meu álbum de estreia

[Instrumental]

[Refrão]
Olhei pro topo, como tá?
Nosso espaço, como tá?
Nosso lado, como tá?
Caminho escuro, ok?
Por isso pode vir depois que eu passei
Olhei pro topo, como tá?
Nosso espaço, como tá?
Nosso lado, como tá?
Caminho escuro, ok?
Por isso pode vir depois que eu passei

Everyone copies our recipe, out of this planet technology, true"
Lógos,,male,Toys (Ft. Callister),"[Letra de ""Toys"" com niLL & Callister]

[Verso 1: niLL]
Criaram, falaram
Tentaram‚ buscaram
Às vezes isso foi demais pra nós
Lutaram‚ deixaram
Passaram‚ levaram
Surfaram e pensaram em quem se foi
Mostraram, entenderam
Venderam, souberam de tudo e ligaram aqui depois
Correram‚ filmaram
Postaram, curtiram enquanto o sol morreu

[Refrão: Callister]
O dia passa, tudo bem
Do meu céu chove também
Fogo aceso se mantém
Transformando-se porém
O dia passa‚ tudo bem
Do meu céu chove também
Fogo aceso se mantém
Transformando-se porém
O dia passa, tudo bem
Do meu céu chove também
Fogo aceso se mantém
Transformando-se porém
O dia passa, tudo bem
Do meu céu chove também
Fogo aceso se mantém
Transformando-se porém


[Verso 2: niLL]
Acho que ele saiu do canto da sala
Desistiu de desistir, pouca mágoa
Depois de lágrimas no caderno
Letras constroem os castelos
Bebidas pra curar a minha noite
Enche minha memória suas fotos no telefone
E como se fosse hoje
Que chegou a melhora que falavam sobre
Esconda suas flores
Porque a inveja sente o cheiro de longe
Prioridade: seus amores
Se misturam como o mundo e suas cores

[Refrão: Callister]
O dia passa, tudo bem
Do meu céu chove também
Fogo aceso se mantém
Transformando-se porém
O dia passa, tudo bem
Do meu céu chove também
Fogo aceso se mantém
Transformando-se porém
O dia passa, tudo bem
Do meu céu chove também
Fogo aceso se mantém
Transformando-se porém
O dia passa, tudo bem
Do meu céu chove também
Fogo aceso se mantém
Transformando-se porém"

Now let's get something straight
Now let's get something straight
Helluva made this beat, baby

[Verse]
Now let's get something straight
First class Delta flights, I'm above the hate
I was down looking up, now I'm up some pape
It could be worst, God ain’t have to let me up today
Teacher ain't fuck with me because I would come in late
Woke up 100K, I ain't never touch an A
For every class that I failed, I'ma flood the bank
Threw a brick on the gas pedal, I’m like fuck the brake
Yeah, SB, we the team
Started off a seed but we turned into a tree
Had ten dollars but it turned into a sleeve
Used to be friendly but I turned into a beast
That's what happens, ducking snakes in the Amazon
Cracking cards, I'm an ape in the Scamazon
Good Runtz, what's this planet I landed on?
Oh shit, never mind, this a star I'm standing on
Talking 'bout we kin? LOL, whatever, cousin
God walking to me, whole time the Devil running
Fraud God, I'm at the self-scan pressing buttons
Feel like Jimi Hendrix, I'm at Hard Body's metal clutching
Said he fucking with me? Tell him hang himself
Heart jumped out my chest from the pain I felt
A bitch gon' be a bitch, bro, take that L
I was finna drown, bitches left, they ain't stay and help
Bitch heard my song like, ""Yeah, he sweet for sure""
Up chop and let it go like I'm Keyshia Cole
In a different world with it, C-3PO
Do you know what I could do off of three Visas, bro?
I ain't finna battle with you, this ain't Pokémon
Chopstick got a light, feel like Obi Wan
Finna slam dunk this ho, Dee throwing lobs
Setting plays up, I think I need a coaching job
Who not winning? Lil' bitch, you a stupid fuck
Elevated to a different level like a Buddhist monk
You gon' need kryptonite to stop a super punch
Old head talking 'bout the past, got to prove it, unc'
Shooter got a Ray Gun, they thought I sent an alien
He spent Curry in the mall, left with Damian
If I up it, I'ma probably stretch his cranium
A hundred shots, fuck a jab, this ain't WrestleMania
I'm with Prince, double cup full of Purple Rain
Forza 3 type shit when I'm swerving lanes
You're a clerk, I'm a swiper, we don't work the same
They ain't see the wave coming, hit 'em with a hurricane
Ain't no hoes here, man, I bet Stan chalk 'em
Thinking that he balling, knock the headband off him
Demons taking over, this the deadman talking
Black skinnies, black boots, this the deadman walking
Give his ass a tombstone, Undertaker
Was in church with some gift cards up my blazer
I ain’t buy it in the mall, I'ma punch it later
Love the love but most importantly I love the haters"
Bin Reaper,,male,Lost It (Ft. Lil Yachty),"[Intro: BabyTron]
Ayy
Helluva made this beat, baby
Shitty Boyz

[Verse 1: BabyTron]
On my own wave, in a lil' boat, for real
Lil Boat and Tron? Two GOATs, for real (On God)
Shooter might drop a nuke, he on overkill
On this VPN, invisible like the Boatmobile (Skrrt-skrrt)
Black Louis belt, take it off and sensei him (Bitch)
Grab the work and shake it up, feel like Zendaya (Ayy, ayy)
Made a dub OT, boy, that's ten layers (Twenty, boy)
Threw a hundred on the chop, I'ma Ben Franklin
Pourin' lines of the red like a typo (Woo)
In the spaceship, UFO and nitro (Skrrt)
Dragging bags off the fire, Spyro
Scorin' dolo, boy, I'm Ivo on the iso (Ivo)
Bitch dumb, I just pulled eighty phones out her (I did)
Shawn Michaels, told her suck it, I'm a show stopper (Slapped that bitch)
Good thrax and it smell like Davy Jones' Locker
Turned him to a ghost with the Tommy, I want more power
Dead inside, I ain't got no heart left (I don't)
In deep, saw my hoodie got a shark head
Send a super missile at him if he Clark Kent
Just dropped a hundred checks listenin' to ""Dark Web""
[Hook: BabyTron & Lil Yachty]
I done looked Death in the eyes and lost him (Whew)
All that love in my heart, I lost it
Where I'm at now, it was worth all the losses
Been runnin' from karma my whole life, I'm exhausted (I'm exhausted)
And I'm just glad that I lost her (I am)
The pain in the rain turned me to a monster (It did, Tron)
Put my feelings down and picked up an embosser
Flea-flicker, I'ma pass her after Yachty toss her (Ayy, yeah)

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Big boss, on my hand sixty grand large
Lots of automatic chops, sound like El DeBarge
Five racks for that weapon, I've been livin' large
Nigga try me, I piece up his body like a MasterCard
I'm in Miami at the East, twenty floors up
I used to scam i8s, left the doors up
I fuck on real model bitches, get your hoes up
Hang around cons and pros, throwin' fours up
'Member gettin' locked movin' sloppy down in south Florida
Three years later, rich as hell, earrings size of quarters
Too many shoes in my closet, label me a hoarder
My brother [?][1:32] but he love to slaughter
Gettin' hate from OG's, I'ma fuck their daughter
She want me to rap to her like I'm Vince Carter
Even back when I was broke, I didn't ride MARTA
Piece done struck hard on my Uber, I was goin' farther
[Hook: BabyTron]
I done looked Death in the eyes and lost him
All that love in my heart, I lost it
Where I'm at now, it was worth all the losses
Been runnin' from karma my whole life, I'm exhausted
And I'm just glad that I lost her
The pain in the rain turned me to a monster
Put my feelings down and picked up an embosser

Me and Stan? Just fucked up AT&T

[Verse]
Me and Stan? Just fucked up AT&T
Splash Bros with it, we just made three a piece (Splash)
Send his spirit to the air like a BNB
And if the head right, I’ll put her in some D&G
Bitch saw me one time and was on balls
Fuck a DC, do I look like John Wall?
I'm finna up this one shit, that's beyond y’all
She know I'm the man, answering if Tron call
Walked through the rain, now my fits wet as hell
Amiri jeans, Triple S’s, bitch, can't you tell?
I'm the G-O-A-T, bitch, can’t you spell?
A hundred dollars for a gram, bitch, can’t you smell?
Tryna fuck but the bitch want to cuddle first
Put it on Jesus I'ma ball, Shuttlesworth
Goated on Saks, think I’m finna punch another shirt
Swear to God, what I been through would make your stomach hurt
If you made ten bucks every time you dick sucked
Ha, I ain't gon' lie, you would've been up
But you broke and you dirty, get your check up
I Liu Kang that bitch out the whip, pick yo bitch up
Big chop, bro gon' fuck around and eat you with it
I could bust you with this Glock, I'd rather beat you with it
Heart dark, I don't got a ounce of peaceful in it
Bitch, you really suck, me and you cannot be equal with it
I took that L, picked it up and turned it to a dub
I made a plan, put in work, and turned into the plug
I got bitches in the mall asking for a hug
I'ma punch you dead in your shit asking for a slug
Told dukes, ""I'ma pop, can't you see, ma?""
Been the winning side, boy, fuck a team hop
Please stop, I touch chicken like a Wing Stop
Bro an Angry Bird, he get busy with that slingshot
Ha-ha, BabyTron, bitch, I'm bound to blow
She was just on my dick, now it's down her throat
Do the bear crawl if it's cheese on the floor
I ain't falling off 'less I see a bag down below
But if it's in the air, I'ma jump up
Who broke? Boy, you sound like a dumb fuck
Ain't no upper cuts when I say I'm 'bout to punch up
Had a better season than Giannis, got my bucks up"

That's a dumbass question, we know they can't fuck with me
Ha, this shit too easy
Ayy, ayy, ShittyBoyz

[Hook]
Oh, you made ten bands? Whoopty fucking do
Looking in the mirror like, “Tron, they can’t fuck with you”
Scam God, turned a slug to a couple blues
Voice in my head saying, “Tron, they can’t fuck with you” (They can’t fuck with you)
Ha-ha, on God they can't fuck with me
Ran up the score, check the board, dawg, we up fifty (We up fifty)
All that ho shit you pulled? Stuck with me
Made a hundred by myself, they can’t fuck with me

[Verse 1]
My teacher thought that I was slow as fuck
I ain’t need math to touch twenty, bitch, I'm going up (Bing)
Feel like a MOAB, bitch, I'm blowing up
Twenty-five kills through this bitch, shooter going nuts
Granny yelling like, “Tron, why you leave the porch?” (Why?)
Had to get my head in the game, EA Sports (Ha)
If it's online, huh, then it’s free for sure
Bitch playing games, I am not a PS4 (Bitch)
Grabbed a hundred jacks off an Android
Two straps on me, leave 'em wet like I’m Blastoise
Stop sending me them links, you ass, boy
Told that bitch give me space like an asteroid (Give me space)
In the kitchen cooking up like I'm Based God
Bro shooting opps in real life, he don’t play COD
Money mission, money mission, feel like James Bond
Look at yourself, I can’t beef with no gay bop (I can’t)
Get the fuck off my phone, I’m embossing a piece (Woo)
Stan quarterback to back so I’m Austin in T (Woo)
If you plan on offing me then you off of the beans
Hopping on this wave? You gon’ probably get lost in the sea (Bye)
Can’t remember last time that I got a favor (I can’t)
Scoring off the turn arounds like a shot creator (Turn around)
If the steak fucked up, I'ma pop the waiter
AR'll put him in a suit like a commentator

[Verse 2]
Just punched three X’s, Tentacion
Said he gon’ kill me but he probably won’t (He won’t)
Bitch knocking stores out, call her ""Holly Holm""
Jugging with some gel in my hair, call me ""Bobby Jones"" (On God)
Ha-ha, Shawn Michaels, I’m a heartbreaker (Woo)
I'm just chilling like a villain, feel like Darth Vader
Been scoring, OT, I’m the star player
Put a bullet in his atrium, fuck a heart grazer
Hitmonlee, stick got mega kick
Beyblade chop, up the stick and I’ll let it rip
Rolling out with that shot like I set a pick
Real backwards shit, checked his temp then I left him sick (Ha)
In the store itching bad, I’m a fraud addict (Woop)
Good punch from Hawaii, this bitch volcanic
Shock his ass like I’m Raiden, I want all static
If the punch green, Hulk smash, I'ma cause havoc (Hulk smash)
Big chop, do I look like I'm 'bout to fight? (Do I?)
Passive mode with this VPN, I’m out of sight (I’m out of there)
Hibernating in my bag, this my thousandth night
Fucked up a thousand sights 'fore I got a thousand likes (On God)
Just made ten three times, feel like Jokic (Triple double)
Bitch said I’m broke, who dick she smoking?
Off the scam potion, in my zone, bitch, I’m focused
You're a super ham, bitch, stop trying to act heroic

Say some shit I ain’t heard before (Please)
You can’t hide in the crib, this a thermal scope (There he go)
Walk in the strip, hoes know I'm turnt for sure
Dukes said it's obstacles so I had to hurdle those (On God)
I’m just tryna get rich and maybe fuck Karrueche (Aye, aye)
If it’s money back there, I'ma bust a U-ey (Skrrt-skrrt)
Bump yo head with a bullet if you bump into me
In ATL jacked up while I’m bumping Gucci

[Outro]
Ha-ha, no cap, y'all cannot fuck with me
I’m undefeated with this shit
I damn near time traveled with this shit
I’m in a different dimension, catch up, man

One whip, two chops, we spinnin' the block (Spinnin')
Two men, a hundred shots, we spinning his top (Bow)
I'm on everything these niggas is not
With a strap last year and now niggas is dying (Woo)

Both scopes on a nigga, them bitches like headlights

You see that ballcap, dawggie? Throw it on

Spint' the block and caught an opp like a Pokémon
Step in the strip and see the bangs, bitch, you know it's Tron
A hundred death threats, why I ain't dead yet?
Won't chase a bitch unless she truck drives for FedEx
Pissed-ass, broke-ass in your bed stressed
Can't relate, I'm flying with a thirty dollar headrest

New deal offer I ain't even read yet
Heard your man signed for a chain and a bed set
I got a white boy, I be serving ten packs
Get your bitch drunk, wake her up with a stained back

Yeah, I punch and I rap, Def Jam Vendetta
And my new bitch cold, look like Cinderella
Firework with this card, I can get whatever
Sent fifteen out the rocket, boy, that's a Clint Capela (Bow)

[Verse 7: AllStar JR & BabyTron]
Put a circle on a nigga like he Westbrook (That's a donut)
So you really wasting time on your left hook?
If the lambchops suck, get the chef cooked
Scholar with the scam shit, I wasn't reading textbooks
He ain't ashamed, one of mans be popping blues
He ain't ashamed 'cause he gon' end up popping you
You could be Dwayne Johnson, couldn't rock with you
Thinkin' you a star? The chop got telescopic view

Żadne karty nie przeżyją przeciw takim głazom
Przeciw takim gruzom, na lokalu piję Ouzo
Za dużo już tego, ona nie ma siły dmuchać w puzon
Wygląda jak żulica, wciąż jej lajka klikasz
Myślisz po nocach o niej, czule po uszku byś smyrał
Radio Gruz, mówi wodzirej, admirał
Przyjmuję tylko papierki, sorry, zjebał się terminal
Mordziaty, mordęga, znowu się gdzieś szwędam
Chuj w te wasze tutoriale, uczę się na błędach stale
Uczę na przypałach, noszę balast
Jestem mordziaty, a ty balas

Uh, Wizard
Dirty soda, Spike Lee
White girl, Ice T
Fully loaded AP, yeah

[Chorus]
I just fucked your bitch in some Gucci flip flops
I just had some bitches and I made 'em lip lock
I just took a piss and I seen codeine coming out
We got purple Actavis, I thought it was a drought

[Verse 1]
Bitch, I'ma choose the dirty over you
You know I ain't scared to lose you
They don't like it when you're telling the truth
I'd rather be realer than you
I had to make me a cot
Now I called a contractor to make me a spot
I sold the dope out your house
Now you come to my house, I've got dope in the couch
You know I don't fuck with no rumors
Rocking red bottoms like they Pumas
Got these meds on me, I'ma do 'em
I take these pills and I'm having a thrill
Taking prescription's a hell of a feeling
As for the xanny, I never forgot it
Got 'em begging to call up my phone tryna have a menage
Gotta put up the cash, can't even stay in the house
Cause there’s too much to hide
Whip the four to a nine, gotta pay up the rent, I was too far behind
Fuck I'm too out of time, fuck 'em two at a time
Had to do what I had to do to get where I'm at, niggas know I ain't lying
Niggas know I ain't lying
It's a lot on my mind, it's a lot on my plate
But I never complain
I was working the weight like I came out the gym
I never did train
Put the girl on a train
Strapped a bird on her back, now she came back with change, ayy


[Chorus]
I just fucked your bitch in some Gucci flip flops
I just had some bitches and I made 'em lip lock
I just took a piss and I seen codeine coming out
We got purple Actavis, I thought it was a drought
I just fucked your bitch in some Gucci flip flops
I just had some bitches and I made 'em lip lock
I just took a piss and I seen codeine coming out
We got purple Actavis, I thought it was a drought

[Verse 2]
I strapped the dope to your spouse
The first time I gave her an ounce
I put some free bands in her account
I told her, ""Bitch, can't be running your mouth
Better watch what you say to these niggas
Cause you already know what they 'bout""
Put the game in a choke in a knot
Hit that bitch while I'm choking her out
Put that hook on her, now she got love in the south
I got some purp on me now
Stacking these styrofoams up by the double
They done let me back in, now they know they in trouble
Valet the whip by the front door
On a percocet now and I need me some more
Tell me them lies that you want me to hear
I try to forget, but it's hard to forgive
Take me some codeine and pop me a pill
I pull on a blunt and blow smoke out my ears
I smoke on this blunt, I get high as I can
I float off the Earth in designer
I’m working on having some manners
I’m thinking about it right now
I’m holding the cash while I pour up the lean
Then I put one in the air


[Chorus]
I just fucked your bitch in some Gucci flip flops
I just had some bitches and I made 'em lip lock
I just took a piss and I seen codeine coming out
We got purple Actavis, I thought it was a drought
I just fucked your bitch in some Gucci flip flops
I just had some bitches and I made 'em lip lock
I just took a piss and I seen codeine coming out
We got purple Actavis, I thought it was a drought

[Outro]
Thought it was a drought, thought it, thought it was a drought
We thought it was a drought, we poured an Actavis
Bitch, I'ma choose the dirty over you
You know I ain't scared to lose you
They don't like it when you're telling the truth
I'd rather be realer than you

You would fuck a rich nigga for the fame, won't you?
You would give that pussy up to a lame, won't you?
Like an old school, I re-did the frame on you
I got my old shooters with me and they land on you
Word to them niggas out the six

Come and fuck with me, baby, I'm a franchise
Molly and them Xans got me aggravated
Them hundreds and them fifties, got 'em separated
Put them hundreds with them hundreds, yeah, we segregated
They tried to take the soul out me
They tried to take my confidence and they know I'm cocky
Fuck another interview, I'm done with it
I don't give a fuck about lil' ho, I let young hit it
I play the games of the thrones with you
I can't change, I was God-given
Tried to make me a pop star and they made a monster
I'm posted with my niggas lettin' the champagne flow
A nigga was depressed now my mind back healthy
A product of the roaches in them ashtrays
I inhale the love on a bad day
Baptized inside purple Actavis



[Pre-Chorus]
They should've told you I was on a pill
They should've told you I was on a Lear
I served cocaine in some Reeboks
I'm full of so much chronic, need a detox

They should've told you I was just a trap, nigga
I'm in the white house shootin' craps niggas
I gave up on my conscience, gotta live with it
This remind me when I had nightmares
These bitches wanna be here, they'll be right here
They should've told you I was just a trap, nigga
They should've told you I was gon' lap niggas
They should've told you I was overseas
Say his last words, he can't breathe
They sent the ghetto bird out to peep me
They finally did admit that I was cloned
Because I was ambitious, now I'm on
Five in the mornin' on the corner rollin' stones
I just brought the money, I'll count it on my own
Fuck

They should've told you I was on a pill

Fuck that shit, I don't remember none of that shit

[Chorus: Future]
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn't feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn't need me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas tried to run off?
Where your ass was at, dog? You made me pull this gun out

Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas spread lies on him?
Where your ass was at, dog, when the bodies came sliding?
Where your ass was at, dog, when I was serving pies?

[Verse 2: Future]
Where your ass was at, dog, when I was in the Pyrex?
Where your ass was at, dog, when I was drinking Hi-Tech?
Where your ass was at, dog? You came through the projects
Where your ass at? We keep that fully loaded contracts
Had her rain dance on the dick, ass jumping
Running through the pussy like a nigga going jogging
Fuck a little Louis, put it in a bitch pocket
Put a pic with me on the 'gram, now you popping
Where your ass was at when I was trapping in the store?
Had to struggle to get where I'm at and sell dope
Jackie Chan moves got game in the choke
Gas rolling up in the blunt, Amoco
12 tryin' come in the spot to open up the dope
Burglar bar doors got a young nigga confident
Juugin' out the stove and we still bangin', honest
Blowing on the O, yo, we call that ho an onion


[Verse 3: Drake]
Man, where your ass was at when we took the city over?
Where your ass was at when all they'd ask was ""What's the hold up?""
Where your ass was at when niggas first got the news?
Now your ass around because we're paying back dues
Where were you when all the dogs needed help?
Lawyers and the commissary ain't gon' pay itself
Where your ass was at when we recorded in the bathroom?
Where your ass was at? I take attendance like a classroom
Man I ain't got no choice
'Cause nowadays I swear this shit done changed up for the boy
I'm self-made, selfish with my women, self-employed
I'll buy the neighbor's house if they complain about the noise
Man, where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn't feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn't need me?
Where your ass was at? Last winter was the coldest
Fuck where you was at, I had the 6 on my shoulders

[Chorus: Future]
Where your ass was at dog, when niggas wouldn't feed me?
Where your ass was at dog, when bitches didn't need me?
Where your ass was at dog, when niggas tried to run off?
Where your ass was at dog? You made me pull this gun out

[Verse 4: Future]
60 for a walk through, bitch don't panic
Had them bitches fall through fucking like a savage
Heard you tryna swim in the ocean no jacket
Heard that nigga came through squeezing on a ratchet
Heard that nigga came through squeezing on a ratchet
Serve a lot of dog food, call you a mutt
Where your ass was at dog, when I was on my come-up?
The reason I'm here today 'cause I ain't never gave up


[Chorus: Future]
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn't feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn't need me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas tried to run off?

Feeling doesn’t go away (fuck)
I could never love again
I miss Audrey in LA (aw, fuck)
Yeah, I’m hurt and I don’t change
Tell me what you want me to say (fuck)
I feel restless yet again
I don’t want my heart to break (aw, fuck)
Trauma spread across the plane
(When I’m nothin')
Needing help and needing space
(When I’m not there) (fuck)
Try to help me but you can’t
(Am I lost yet?)
Something’s always in the way

Oh baby, what’s bothering you during the night?
Don’t you like all the fairytales and lullabies?

[Verse 2: døves and Wicca Phase Springs Eternal]
I put hate inside of hate (trauma spread across the plane)
But I might never be the same (needing help and needing space)
I can’t feel anything (try to help me but you can’t)
I don’t think I'm gonna change (something’s always in the way)
The feelin’s never here to stay (I put pain inside of pain)
I’m drinkin' just to kill the pain (feeling doesn’t go away)
I guess I’ll wait another day (I could never love again)
I miss Nickie in PA (I miss Audrey in LA)
I’m under club lights, just trying to take my life
If the drug's right, I think that I could get by
Keep the plug tight, and keep my heart on ice
Chase the sunrise, pills got me tongue tied
But it’s alright
Keep sayin’ that it’s alright
When I’m breathing
I took another one just to change the feelin'
Death’s comin' for me, I can feel it
I can feel it, I can feel it

Do you need an escape?
I'll be the hatchway for you
I'll be yours
Leavin' us behind until we die so slowly
So slowly

[Verse 1: døves]
And crush it up, white lies
I was in the club and you were outside
Smoke tearin' at my lungs
Liquor pullin' at my eyes
And the clique is in the back
Switchblade at my side
List changed overnight
Like who the fuck is that side stage?
I can’t fuck with them if we weren’t friends on MySpace
Took another just to try to kill my heartache
Took another just to try to calm my heart rate

[Verse 2: Wicca Phase Springs Eternal]
And put my back, babe
Letting my guard down again, I’m in a bad place
Feel the pressure adding up
I can never get enough
It’s how I can be in love and still my heart breaks
Time, vanishing again
I saw this before
Still I don’t know how it ends
These feelings aren’t me
Forgetting how to breathe
You think I need to sleep
I think that you know best


[Sample]
And the days they come and go so slowly
So slowly

[Verse 3: døves]
Depressed, hi-tech
In time, I'm spent
The drugs, the stress
Those nights, I bled
No love, no rest
No hope, no bed
In time, I’m spent
No life, I'm death

[Verse 4: Wicca Phase Springs Eternal]
When it’s adding up
And I sever ties
I apologize
Everything I’ve done
What I’ve never said
Is I'll never love
Anyone again
I’m not anyone
Who the fuck is that side stage?
I can’t fuck with you if we weren’t friends on MySpace
Took another just to try to kill my heartache
Took another just to try to calm my heart rate

So, won’t you leave a knife in my back
Or a bag in my hand tonight
Another four milligrams tonight

My whole life, suspended in time
A needle in my arm or a needle in my eye

Fallen angel, hold my hand
Fallen angel, wake me up
And help me to relax
The bonds that hold me tethered
And leave me on my back
I call to you
The night is mine
I walk it back
Fallen angel, hold my hand
Fallen angel, take what’s mine

[Verse 2: døves]
You wake me up just to draw me in
Yeah, I’m somethin' like a cigarette
Pullin' off of each other’s breath
""Close your eyes, just settle, settle""
So, hold my hand (settle, settle)
Lift me up
I'm drowning in the light of a dyin' sun
Don’t hold your breath, hold your tongue
I pray for death
I pray for love

[Bridge: døves]
I pray for death, I pray for love
But it never comes

[Verse 3: døves]
You told me, ”close your eyes, just settle”
“They’ll make it through the night if you let 'em”
I’m so sick of carvin' names into headstones
Consider this an open letter
Hennessy and Percocet
Someone’s standin' on my chest
She put her hands around my neck
No sleep, no rest
White lies, tongue tied
So tired, so tired
Met the plug back at Cha Cha
I’m just tryna see heaven
I’ve spent enough time on the back roads
Sippin' red wine, pullin' black smoke
Don’t pick me up, let me go
You’re my great escape, you're my only home
My only home

Don’t pick me up, let me go"

This is Copes, aka the great finessor, and you’re listening to ULTRACLUB4K

Startin' from the top: I miss you
I take issue with my heart
Fallin' over situations
See my character is flawed
Grab onto her and I tell her
“I’m not tryna make it hard”
Baby, I’ll check in on you
If you check on me too
Now and sudden I've become the opposition to the light
There is Adam, separated from the balance in his life
Six times, six ties, six shadows in the night
Cruel angel starts to sing
And I feel everything

[Interlude: døves & Priscilla Kelly]
I can’t feel a thing
But I still feel the beat
This is Priscilla Kelly and you’re listening to ULTRACLUB4K

[Verse 2: døves]
You got me breathin' hard under club lights
I don’t care if I don’t see the sunrise
And I can feel the music from the other side
And I been GBC like my whole life
You got me breathin' hard under club lights
I don’t care if I don’t see the sunrise
And I can feel the music from the other side
And I been GBC like my whole life

Dzień dobry, Młody G

[Zwrotka: Belmondo]
Gdzie jest mój Samsung, dzwoni mój Maxcom
Halko, dzwoni twoja dupa po jebanko
Nie mam czasu, idę robić sianko
Zawijam mandżur, czeka pod klatką cierpus
Przyszedł SMS już
Idę robić SOS, nie mayday
Ty czekasz miesiąc, aż wypłacą pensję
Co ją rozjebiesz w jeden weekend
Zapierdalasz na taśmie jak jebany playback
Ja mam codziennie tutaj payday
Wjechałeś na uczelnię zrobić papier, ja też
Tylko że mój papier jest to cash
Tylko że to inny uniwersytet
Każdy dzień to test
Jedyny nauczyciel, jaki tutaj jest, to czas
Mam w bani cyferblat"

Bawię się bez wódy, tylko w burdel-hotel
Nie chodzę do klubu, ze mną mała bubu, Warsaw
Wychodzę z klatówy, pogonić grudy za grube stówy
Trafia się pasożyt, zanim poda rękę słyszę pożycz, nie rozumiem
Nie umiesz zarobić, to idź coś zapierdolić
Towar swój wyćpałeś, zamiast go pogonić
Bardzo Cię boli, jak ląduje gładko
Trudno to osiągnąć, uprawiając hardcore
Prawdziwy hardcore, dziś spotkałem diabła
Miałem piątkę w kości, jest osiemnasta

Siedziałem nocą sam najebany nad ruletką
Aż poznałem sobie lepszą

[Refren: Sentino]
Twoje serce jest dzikie, serce jest dzikie, serce jest dzikie
Pożałujesz jak zniknę, pożałujesz jak zniknę
Kiedyś myślałem, że minie co złe i że do nas należy ten świat
Dziś zgasła nadzieja jak jedna wśród milionów gwiazd
Skąd ty to znasz?
Straciłem przez hazard 6 lat
Skąd ty to znasz?
Pozdrawia mnie braciak zza krat
Skąd ty to znasz?
Nie będzie nigdy już nas
Skąd ty to znasz? (x3)

[Zwrotka 2: Diho]
Skąd ty to znasz, skąd ty to znasz
Znowu wydam na wódę tu wszystko co mam
Napiszę twój zombie, twój orangutan
Odpiszesz: ja nie chce cię znać
Ja kochanie cię kocham jak Kora Maanam
Choć nie jesteś dziewicą jak Doda
Nie pasujemy jak ona do Cannes
To tak myślę, że jest trochę szkoda wam

[Refren: Sentino]
Twoje serce jest dzikie, serce jest dzikie, serce jest dzikie
Pożałujesz jak zniknę, pożałujesz jak zniknę

Chciałbym żebyś wiedział brat, że nikt nie wspomina cię tu
Choć nigdy nie minie ten ból
Każdy udaje, że nie ma cię już
Pamiętam ten śmiech i ten luz
Jakby lata odsiadki nie były niczym wyjątkowym
W tym cały problem
Rodzina chce widzieć byś był tylko cały i zdrowy

Zabójstwo liryczne 3.0,,male,Pistolet,"[Zwrotka 1: Sentino]
Czas na rozpierdol, to nie czas na melanż
Straciłem życie, czas by nowe zacząć teraz
Wrogów trzymam bliżej od rodziny tu
Ciągle na ulicy, trzy godziny snu
Sam nie wiem jak skończę, a widziałem dno
Zatykam uszy, diabeł mówi, ja słyszałem go
Serce mam z kamienia, już nie boli mnie
Albo chcesz pogrzeb mieć albo dzwoń po tą policje

[Refren: Sentino](x2)
Ciągle czegoś mi brak, jak miałem nic to byłem szczęśliwszy
Najlepszy miałem swój czas
Z głową w chmurach, a w ręku whisky
A teraz tylko ja i ten pistolet tu
Teraz tylko ja i ten pistolet tu

[Zwrotka 2: Sentino]
Lata tu mijają tracę młodość w tym
Dążę jak na haju za tym sosem, man
Ciągle robię dym, chciałem wyjść, siedzę znowu w tym
Dzisiaj kręci mnie dobry strzał, wczoraj dobry rym
Straciłem przyjaciół, straciłem pieniądze, straciłem nadzieje
Zdobyłem tu szacun i stałem się w końcu prawdziwym złodziejem
Teraz tylko ja i ten pistolet tu
Nie ma Rolexów, nagle już nie ma kolegów


[Refren: Sentino](x2)
Ciągle czegoś mi brak, jak miałem nic to byłem szczęśliwszy
Najlepszy miałem swój czas

A teraz tylko ja i ten pistolet tu

Wczoraj buty Louis Vuitton albo Gucci, ziom
Dzisiaj plik za plikiem, żeby matce kupić dom
Nie zrozum mnie źle, on nigdy nie zrozumie, że
Ten hajs nie kocha, a jak kocha, to go do trumny weź
Papier przychodzi, ten sam papier mija ale ja zostaje
Ludzie są różni dla ciebie, a dla mnie są dwa rodzaje
Człowiek lub frajer, cwaniak lub szakal, lew albo hiena
Rodzina to wszystko, a braci tu raczej już nie ma"

Bags underneath my eyes, bitch, I need sleep
But I'm out of town jamming till I hear a beep-beep
Scoring now, feel like Shaq with the 3P
In the stu' with Helly, nah, boy, fuck yo free beat

[Verse 2: StanWill]
Fireman on my ass 'cause I keep heat
Put your dusty-ass fits down, fuck a three piece
Squaring up? I'll send you where the priests be
Reaching for the balls, bitch a freak freak

[Verse 3: TrDee]
Told that bitch give me space, I need three feet
Your whole team full of perping niggas that be three deep
She mad, I'm just tryna hit her like a DE
To be a hundred, I'ma spin her ass like a CD

[Verse 4: BabyTron]
Tryna wrestle? I ain't Randy Orton though
We walk around with movie clips, we the Warner Bros
I brought that bitch in and out like a corner store
Foreign ho sucked the whole dick, fuck a boring ho



[Verse 5: StanWill]
Told her it's my all, gave that bitch a quarter though
Sixty for a three five, boy, you can't afford to blow
Love from the bay but I'm onto Florida hoes
Black and white Raf Simons, stepping in some Oreos

[Verse 6: TrDee]
Got real nigga in my veins, you was born a ho
Her mama down stairs, still make her hit a note
[?] I ain't really wanna hit the ho
We doing ten if they see this, baby, close the door

[Verse 7: BabyTron]
It's over for your granny if I get her SSN
Exquisite Loubs with the spikes, what I'm stepping in
Devil knocking on the door, I can't let him in
Bitch ran off with my heart once, learned my lesson then

[Verse 8: StanWill]
Kung Lao, how I punch you with this mega BIN
Turned dawg swiss cheese if I up the FN then
Do I look like AI? Who you questioning?
Scat too loud, I'ma pull up in the Tesla then

[Verse 9: TrDee]
Tryna pull up to the store? We gotta test this BIN
Real sauce on me, boy, call me ""Method Man""
Right hook so strong, I'ma test his chin

[Verse 1]
Every star player has an off night
I turned off-brand into Off-White
Guarantee you run up on me, that's a lost life
Your boyfriend a dirtball, this that sauce life
Stamina in credit, boy, I'm runnin' up a check
Track star in Saks Fifth, I'm runnin' up the set
Run up, try to flex, that's a hundred to your neck
I got 'em sick, bro, they can't stomach what I spent
I'd still talk shit if I ain't have a mouth
And I work for this shit, it wasn't handed out
I knew the bitch was easy, I ain't really have a doubt
Used to crack jokes 'bout the kid but I'm laughin' now
Hoes used to ho me, I ain't need them though
I ain't scared of death, bitch, I'm scared of being broke
Look in the mirror, hell yeah, I see the GOAT
She sent my soul through the roof, yeah, she a pro
We ain't up now? That shit new to me
Shoot me? Wouldn't even shoot a three
I don't scrap but the punches are like UFC
I'm plugged in, charged up like a USB
Hockey sticks, we'll slide like a Mighty Duck
You a dickhead if you try your luck
Fire hazard every time I'm 'bout to slide a dunk
Raf Simons on, you won't catch me in no Hyperdunks


[Hook]
Yeah, I'm the star player
Used to be sixth man, I'm the star player
Scorin' now, hell nah, I ain't no ball player
Took a few risks, now I'm feelin' like the star player
Ha, yeah, bitch, I'm the star player
Used to ride the bench, now I'm the star player
Scorin' now, hell nah, I ain't no ball player
Took a few trips, now I'm feelin' like the star player

[Verse 2]
Bitch said I'm actin' dumb, nah
I just wanted head like a mugshot
Swear to God I just had a pack of dubs rocks
Stick got some power, boy, that's a pack a punch Glock
I would hate to be your losing-ass
Used to play Midnight Club, now I do the dash
Punch here, punch there with my abusive-ass
Hit her with a juke move with my elusive-ass
All that fake shit, nah, I can't be around it
All that snake shit, nah, I can't be around it
All that hate shit, nah, I can't be around it
I ain't gon' miss one shot if the beam up on it
Heartbeat sensor on the chop so don't take a breath
Red bottoms on, that's a band when I take a step
Non-balling-ass, you the type to go and blame the ref
Game face activated, no, I can't break a sweat
This life, just wait till I activate
I was in a bad mood till that package came
Got that Drac' on my side like a Raptors game
Came up stealin' like I jumped in the passing lane
The only time you shot OT was for AAU
You ain't never touch ten, I done made a few
Only eighteen but I was born that plus eighty-two
Sent eight out the .30, now it got Baby Smoove


[Hook]
Yeah, I'm the star player
Used to be sixth man, I'm the star player
Scorin' now, hell nah, I ain't no ball player
Took a few risks, now I'm feelin' like the star player
Ha, yeah bitch, I'm the star player
Used to ride the bench, now I'm the star player
Scorin' now, hell nah, I ain't no ball player
Took a few trips, now I'm feelin' like the star player

[Verse 3]
Hmm, should I fuck up Big Beaver?
Nah, I'ma just fuck up some chip readers
Self-scanning in my hoodie, I'm the Bin Reaper
Got it off the strength, now I'm flexing like a gym teacher
Feel like Jet Li, foreign kicks when I walk
Crunchwrap supreme, bitch, that's just how I talk
Plankton-ass boy, stop beggin' for the sauce
Ain't never been no worker, bitch, I always been a boss
Dukes lie when she say ain't shit free in life
'Cause I'ma make a twenty ball if I leave tonight
Steak bites, smack the chef if they ain't season right
They ain't have no Masters on the side? This a Visa night
Steady blowin' up my phone, this bitch need a life
Yeezy Boost off the joggy, that's Adidas life
You still rock Samoas? Boy, them Adidas strife
Ain't no need to fight, bro'll send dawg to Jesus Christ

Lil' bro, what you slide and what you punch?
Heard you freaky like Pinky but yo ass still [?]
Tell bro got that blick, it can knock off his muffin
Told her I just want the neck, now she huffing and puffing
When I catch dawg, that's his ass
And he better pray his ass run fast
Do you know the feeling of not having cash?
If this rap shit was a wave, ShittyBoyz never on last
Listen, bro, I talk shit 'cause I can
Fuck I look like beefing with a fan?
'Cause you faithfully watching my stories
Doing this scam while yo ass always worried
Ass up, face down, no other way
When you shoot that strap, boy, you look the other way
Niggas sliding down while the boys run the other way
Niggas talking down, hating, shit, just another day
Another day running up that cheese
If you got some cheese, say cheese
I like it better when you on your knees
And remember being bummy and we had to rock Lee's?
I just caught a play, we up up
All my real shooters hold your sticks up
BabyTron made cheese off that six plus
And when you charging for the sauce, you gon' need about six plus
Catch plays with my bitch, call her ""Candace Parker""
The only nigga on my head is my fucking barber
[?] I'm grinding for the riches on a fucking Charger
Now I'm grinding for a milli' like that nigga Carter
Girl, throw it back, that ain't your best
I'm feeling real good, bring your best
Don't let 'em see your paper like a test
Called BJ, bro said I'm always good on the West
All my East side niggas, throw your E's up
Go and bust a jugg, nigga, put that weed up
'Cause I swear my next jugg is your re-up
It must've feel good to make cheese with your feet up
""Can I be in ShittyBoyz?"", uh, maybe
If you get that bank account and that social, watch your baby
God forgive me for my sins [?]
[?] in a daily
You really call that freak bitch your baby?
Asked her how it taste, she said tasty
My dawg sending bullets like he Brady
ShittyBoyz falling off? Bitch, you crazy
Bend it over, red nose like you're Rudolph
Put her hair up, now my socks getting blew off
Shot-out to the niggas that made it out, [?]
Where's the money? Where's the conversation?
Niggas gon' exclude y'all
Big slime, big dawg, big ball
Really helped you that hard when your ass solo
And them niggas that you think crispy still ball roll
And this piece still hitting, two for one combo
We gon' slide after we slide, turn around and wake the block up
Niggas wanna steal the sauce, imitators tryna mock us
And they see we coming up so the haters wanna stop us
ShittyBoyz is on top, can't no niggas ever top us
I hear a lot of this and that, niggas better come with some facts
Not no hoes, not no pussies, none of that
A nigga stay on our dick like our sack
See dawg out, he turn Sonic
Fucking for some hours off the chronic
You keep a .30 like you Curry, how ironic
These niggas telling stories, writing comments
Niggas see me out and go mute
They say shooters always gon' shoot
So what you think my thugs gon' do?
ShittyBoyz coming harder, times two"
3-Peat,,male,Jet Li by StanWill,"[Verse]
Fuck a cocaine but the 1's Off-White
Fuck a bad game, Tron, ain't no off nights
Foreign-ass kicks, I can't even walk right
Nigga, pass me a water 'cause I really talk spice
MCM black belt on, feel like Jet Li
Beggin' for the sauce, I'll smack him into next week
You will never win 'cause you worried 'bout the next freak
Kicks be exquisite when I walk, I can't step cheap
If it's money on the floor, I'm on the floor too
Super Saiyan with this punch, feel like Goku
You is not a shooter, you ain't got a lot of pro tools
Bro'll take dawg out the game how a coach do
If it's cheese outta town, I'm on the interstate
If it's cheese on the Moon, then I'm outer space
Bitch blowin' up my phone, get up out my face
Walkin' out the store with more gifts than a holiday
Purpin' on the 'Gram but I see right through the cover up
Know the kicks were free, boy, they came off a uppercut
Known to keep a sleeve on me, bitch. I’m Mr. Button-Up
Bro will shoot the scene like Richtown, don't get buttered up
Head so incredible, I jumped out my socks
Workin' everyday, I can't jump off the clock
Baggy-ass jeans, you should jump out them Rocks
If you broke, walk to a cliff and jump off the top
Made it rain in this bitch, I'm the anchorman
Brodie clappin' at the opps like a Gators fan
Know I got more bread on me than a bakersman
If can't nobody count on me then the banker can
Zoey 201, got my white bitch jammin'
Bitch played it crazy like her chip ain't scannin'
Long as it's hams, I'ma keep on hammin'
And as long as it's scams, I'ma keep on scammin'
I remember back when I couldn't punch a pizza
Now my shit hit, punchin' harder than Vegeta
Reach for anything, you get wrapped like a pita
Bitch so boujee, boy, I love me a diva
Calm down, bro, we uncharted with the Drac'
Thinkin' I'm a lick, I'll send him to the gates
Niggas like to slither, I'll beware of all the snakes
Push the pedal to the metal, I ain't care about no brakes
Super roll on me, I ain't hit the mega million
Throw the motherfucker, got me pullin' her Brazilian
Stream power in the stick, it'll wreck the building
Don’t get caught up in the crossfire, bro pop civilians
Took a dark path, I ain't care about no light
Learn how to punch, I ain't care about no fight
Smacking-ass BIN, I ain't care about no price
Mama told me life's a gamble, I ain't care about no dice
Bitch said I'm full of shit, well I'm a ShittyBoy
Give a fuck about a bitch, girl, I'm a city boy
Ice buffs off two chains, bro, Tity Boi
Rockin' out with the Draco, it get litty, boy
Wouldn't fight a soul, why the fuck would I do hand to hand?
Flash on the stick, don't get lit up like an ambulance
Really juggin' grannies, I believe the pack is landin', man
Mr. Scam Man made a way off of hammin' hams
If it ain't Insta, boy, I won't touch a gram
Off that one app, I done made a insta band
And I whipped this bitch ass tryna make a Flipagram
I don't know where I would be if I ain't never jugg and ham
Shooter dropped a care package, on his fifth body
Picky with the hoes, only on my fifth body
In love with fuckin' credit up, it's a sick hobby
When I drop the Prezi on the bitch, call me ""Ben Romney""

[Verse 1: BabyTron]
Bitch, what? I'll turn into a grave digger
Thinking that you up, I'ma pull up, shoot a game winner
Double back twice in the store with the same hitter
How you want it, dawg, breath taker or the brain splitter?
Steak dinner now, it used to be leftovers
I ain't always ball, started off as a bench warmer
Star player now, that's probably why yo bitch bent over
Ball like AI, you're Tyronn, don't get stepped over
If her credit suck, that's a pointless-ass convo
Whole team scoring, passing plays out like Lonzo
Jam after jam, just hit Krogers with a combo
Good little drip, he might get splashed, wear a poncho
Steak bites and more, just asked the waiter for some A1
Thirty day grind, bitch, I made five on day one
Made three off one play, I kinda felt like Trae Young
.40 charged up, it'll zap you like a ray gun
Pockets speak facts or I could switch to the punchlines
It's 2:01 PM and I'm at Krogers, bitch, that's punch time
Ain't never been a shrimp but I'm at Ocean Prime for lunch time
I ain't gon' say I cashed the kicks, bitch, I punch mine
The way I up the chop, you would thought that I was scared to box
Gucci flops on, I paid two for a pair of socks
King of the scams, bitch, I'm feeling like De'Aaron Fox
Scat Pack roaring, I'ma call that bitch ""Triceratops""


[Verse 2: StanWill]
Jack in the Box, it ain't popping out the seal
Heart on the tee but love ain't what I feel
Gone off a Perc', brodie rolling like a wheel
Wouldn't test doggy, Iron Man with the steel
Running out of Somerset, dragging body bags
You won't get no money hating, with yo sloppy-ass
Got a bitch with the tats, look like Rocky Badd
Give a order to my troops, they gon' copy that
Skipping class but I'm still a scholar with the 201s
If he catch the opps, I don't know what bro would do to one
Dawg strapped, I would be a fool if I threw a one
Speed limit in the clip, bet you he'll noodle some
I'ma slide in Wally World like the floor's wet
Wouldn't know it but I came from where it's cold at
MIA, you can catch me where the Pros at
Bet I catch you losing-ass niggas where some hoes at
Big drip on me, she said, ""Boy, you can dress dress""
Love me a freak that's gon' lick up the excess
Dick got her running everywhere with a red check
I'ma push her credit to the max for the excess
Bitch ripped the heart out my chest and she stepped on it
Feeling like the world on my back, threw a X on it
Bro need a tutor 'cause his belt got some F's on it
If she got Chase, the only time I put a check on it


[Verse 3: TrDee]
Fuck friends, I'm tryna get cool with some clerks
Boy, you don't scam enough, yo ass need to go to work
On tip, tryna fuck, fuck around and take a Perc'
ShittyBoyz big drip, pay the sleeve for the shirt
No, I'm not matching weed, you can come match these blues
No, you're not really my mans, most y'all niggas just cool
I'm in love with Hennessy, I ain't mean to be rude
Yes, you look good, baby, but you look better when you nude
Rocks 2016, please throw them hoes away
You not shitting with the bitches, better try another day
Splash Bros with the work, Stan, you Steph or you Klay?
When you winning, niggas don't see that, act like they Ray
Y'all hating on the gang, we ain't even in our prime
She told me I'm full of shit and I know that I'm fine
Baby, can I put you on the cam, do you mind?
Blew her back out and now this bitch screaming that it's mine
Never fuck with the [?] boy, I got it off the scams
Bro staring mighty hard, is he a opp or a fan?
Yes, I used to be broke as hell, we turning back [?]
Now I'm out the way, propping back up with them bands
I'm tired of niggas talking about they punching, punch what?
Bitch, how the hell you bougie and you living out a hut?
Used to spin me on a daily, now this bitch wanna fuck
And your niggas lying to you, your music really suck

Waitin' for crackheads, rollin' up sours
These niggas watch too many damn movies
This is not Empire, this is not Power
Homie got strung out stuck on the powder
I said I'ma do it, them niggas, they doubted me
My aunties and uncles and cousins, they proud of me
I used to do burglaries, used to do robberies
I used to fight demons but now I embrace them
Always KKK like a racist
I got tunnel vision when it come to that paper
Don't come out this way, lil nigga, it's dangerous
Walk in the trap, I feel like a mayor
These niggas be writing statements and singin'
Straight drop hit like Mike Will Made It
Not scared of death but scared of being famous
Ay, everybody claim they a street nigga
Everybody claim they a killer
Until some real street shit happen, now he claim he ain't in it
I accept the blame, I don't blame niggas
These niggas is thots, I don't hang with niggas
Til I die I'm be on the [?] nigga
Catch an opp lackin', make him famous nigga

I used to think demons was scary
As a kid I used to have a night light
Now the beam on the Glock like a night light
I used to think monsters was in my closet
I ain't cry about the twin towers
I was too young to analyze it
Only cry to myself about my problems
Grandma raised me but I love my mama
Even though I don't fuck with my mama
Hell yeah I bust my gun by my mama
Niggas know in the hood they don't fuck with my mama
I'm never too far I'm just like karma
Jump out the cut look like grim reaper
Nigga said he got the price cheaper
These niggas thots, they move like divas
I told you before I don't fight my demons
I roll up, drink and smoke with my demons
I pop these beans to cope with my demons
Nigga said he can't pay, I told him he can keep it
Everything I learned in my life is a blessing
Take my kindness for weakness and learn your lesson
That's your homie, that's on you to go check him
I been robbing forever and I don't regret it (yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh)
I don't ride around with my [?] on me
I pray to god they don't tell on me
I really got real felonies
You ain't got no m's, not signing me
Ain't too many niggas independent like me



[Outro]
Ay, you know what I'm sayin'? Everybody wanna holla they independent, you know what I'm sayin'? They independent artist, independent hustler, but when you independent, you use your own thoughts, your own money, your own brain, you know what I'm sayin'? Orchestrate that plan by yourself, you put it to work. That's independent, you know what I'm sayin'? You out here holdin' your hand out. You out here runnin' around like thots [?], you know what I'm sayin'? Niggas is TV niggas. Niggas is actors and actresses. Crack Therapy 4.

Jump in the front, let's ride
Interning at faith but I just got hired
360 with God and I can't get fired
Hot boy but I'm cold standing in the blue fire
Prada from the neck down, don't bother
Deep inside a dream I saw shapes of wet water
(And I felt some type of way)

[Verse 1]
Lusi on the track right, get your track right
We pull up on BMX bikes like the Fab 5
So I walked up in the mall right, did the swipe, swipe
Then I gave away my Moncler in the sacrifice
It's kinda funny 'cause you're so mad and IDGAF
I just wanna have fun
Im switching styles up with the season
Need no reason to, I just do whatever I like
Too many times they tried to do me dirty
Make me feel like I'm not worthy of what I've got
You've gotta keep a very calm composure
Strong and sober, I'll do whatever I like

[Verse 2]
Three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three
Let me know what it's gonna be
Three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three
You better push up on me
For free, for free, for free, for free
I'll teach you how you gotta be
I should've never went to school
I should've been the one to teach
Made it from the kids league to the big finals
It's the nine fold path, noblest striver
If I win I'm gonna get out of the rebirth cycle
I'm gonna hit it out the park and then I'm gonna go higher

[Bridge]
But sometimes I lost my focus
Love does it
And it's never just that easy
No I don't trust it
No but I know what I know
I know what I know (Yeah, I know)
I know what I know (Yeah, I know)
I know what I know (Uh-uh)
No, I know what I know

Jump in the front, let's ride
Interning with faith but I just got hired

I am not anyone, I'm just some air inside the air
A piece of sand in all the sand, drop of water in the ocean
It may not seem that way, but I can promise you it's that
But enough of that, I'm coming back, I jump right back into the trash

Walk on promised roads (Ha), I could take a joke (Haha)

Greatness for us
If you believe in luck
Trust the sacred
Oh, just a touch, it's not enough
A place beyond the lust and temptations of love
Complete annihilation of us
Walk in light, see with anothеr eye
SG, we fortifiеd
I've been down bad trying to get back up
Had to make it worse, even more so
So, when I'm at my lowest, there's no other way
I'd only go up, I hope it's so
Fear of death and stress causes stress and fear of death
I can't lie, I must confess
Fear of death and stress causes stress and fear of death
I'm tryna see it as a test
I'm praying to God, please god may you bless me (Please God)
Still the same me but, baby, lately I've been messy
I must forgive myself before you can even forgive me
The shell is pretty, the Devil's busy
Oh, looks desperately for a sign, it's trials and tribulation time
The brave attempt fails and falls flat, he tries to take everything back
He's sure that something will go wrong, and that makes everything go wrong
But still the hope it's strong (The road is long you must go on)



[Bridge]
(Your love, your love, your love)
I'm falling twice every time, I just take a look in your eyes
(Your love, your love, your love)
In your arms, I'm a child, in your arms
(Your love, your love, your love)
I'm falling twice every time, I just take a look in your eyes

Takes me up, lifts me up

Nur mein Schatten, irgendwie, irgendwo
Nichts ging mehr, denn ich war schon tot
„Atme, Junge, du musst weiteratmen, Junge!“
Ausm Off in meinem Kopf diese Stimme
Drei EPs später – mein Name in aller Munde
Schwenk' das KitschKrieg-Banner, dreh' 'ne Ehrenrunde

[Part 1]
Alle überrascht
War zurück über Nacht
Ausm Nichts, hab's geschafft
Alles neu, alles passt
Nur noch mit der Fam, brauch' keine Helfer
Die Welt arschkalt, wird immer kälter
Nur noch mit der Fam, helfen uns selber
Schletti ist der Don, machen alles selber

Weil alles echt ist

[Intro: Trettmann]
Brille, Shorts, Jersey, dreißig Grad
Baller raus, nehm's nicht mit ins Grab
Gar nicht lange her, noch vor paar Jahr'n (Ki-Ki-Ki-Kitschkrieg)
Flogen wir noch unter dem Radar

[Hook: Trettmann]
Jetzt steh'n wir knöcheltief im Wasser in den West Indies
Sonne im Zenit, alles glänzt türkis
Die Besten um mich rum und das Sess schmeckt süß
Viel zu lange weg, hab'n uns es verdient
Knöcheltief im Wasser in den West Indies
Sonne im Zenit und das Sess schmeckt süß
Viel zu lange weg, hab'n uns es verdient
Nur die Besten um mich rum, alles echt

[Part 1: Trettmann]
Formation komplett, keine Limits
Machen, was wir woll'n, alles fitted
Ich schau' mal, wo wir sind, hombre, wicked
Ein Run nach dem andern wie beim Cricket
Gestern haben sie es noch belächelt
Heute hab'n es alle aufm Zettel
Neuer Tag, neues Glück, neues Level
Stell' mein Licht unter keinen Scheffel
Und wenn sie es negier'n, lieg' ich gern falsch
So humble von dem Herb – Christoph Waltz
Gar nicht lange her, weißt du noch als
Das Wasser stand uns allen bis zum Hals

Jetzt steh'n wir knöcheltief im Wasser in den West Indies

Nur mit den Echten, nur mit den Echten
Friede dem Wellblech, Krieg den Palästen
Treff' mich in Kreuzberg (ja!) nur mit den Echten (Trettmann!)
Heute im West End (Gzuz!) nur mit den Echten

[Part 2: Gzuz]
Nur mit den Echten (whoo!)
Meine Jungs sind die besten (187!)
Zu viel gesessen (aaargh!)
Weil zu viel Verbrechen (ja!)
Kenn' meine Fehler (ja!)
Ja, kenn' meine Schwächen (ja!)
Heute im Steakhaus, gestern noch die Nudeln mit Resten (hahaha!)
Früher war mein Leben eine Talfahrt
Alles Abfuck, hatt' nichtmal ein'n Schlafplatz
Heut schlaf' ich jeden Tag woanders
Heut ist der CL 500 Standard (wrmmm!)
Mein halbes Leben hab' ich Plomben verteilt (was?)
Doch dieses Leben hält noch viel mehr bereit (viel mehr!)
So lange Untergrund, doch alles kommt mit der Zeit (ja!)
Heute werd' ich reich mit jedem Song, den ich schreib'!

Grauer Beton, rauer Jargon

Auf und davon, nicht noch eine Saison

Alte Schule, steile Kurve, immer Gegenwind
Folg' dem Wendekind dort hin, wo Ma noch Hände ringt
Unbeschwerte Jahre früh zu Ende sind
Dir niemand sagt, dass es 'n gutes Ende nimmt
In meinem Hauseingang kaum Gutes los
Freunde werden stumpf, werden skrupellos
Lieber schnell leben, ruhelos
Statt Abstellgleis, kein Zielbahnhof

Seelenfänger schleichen um den Block und
Machen Geschäft mit der Hoffnung
Fast hinter jeder Tür lauert 'n Abgrund

Alle guten Dinge komm'n von oben
Der Zebrafink ist mir zugeflogen
Und ab und zu hielt gleich dort wo wir wohn'n
Ein ganzer Lkw voll mit bulgarischen Melon'n
Kids aus Übersee waren unsere Ikon'n
Und weiße Sneaker mehr wert als Million'n
Weiße Sneaker mehr wert als Million'n
Weiße Sneaker mehr wert als Million'n

[Part 2]
Ich denk' heut noch oft zurück an meine Straße
An die Alten und die Kids aus meiner Straße
Aus der Platte, die aus meiner Etage
Man hat uns vergessen dort, Anfang der 90er-Jahre
Desolate Lage, jeden Tag mit der Bagage
Frag nicht, was bei mir ging, hing jeden Tag mit der Bagage
Neue bunte Scheine sprechen eine eigne Sprache
Neue bunte Welt erstrahlt in der Leuchtreklame

Seelenfänger schleichen um den Block und
Machen Geschäft mit der Hoffnung
Fast hinter jeder Tür lauert 'n Abgrund

Ich bleib' mir treu, folge niemanden, alles Schall und Rauch
Den Traum, das Kush und die Lilanen, hab' alles, was ich brauch'
Wach' auf am Abend, greif' unters Bett nach den Ultra Boosts
Muss wieder los, wenn die Straße ruft, hab' den Walkin' Blues
Und würde alles wieder so tun, wenn morgen alles vorbei wär'
Diese Nächte und Bilder dazu, diese Feste bedeuten mir weit mehr
Ein Hoch auf die, die immer da war'n, auch wenn ich scheiter'
Denk' an euch, wenn Dämonen über mir kreisen und zieh' einfach weiter

[Pre-Hook]
Hab' mein Zuhause verlor'n, such' nach 'nem neuen Zuhause
Und auch wenn sich hier alles gleicht, egal, wohin ich auch laufe
Sonne geht auf, die Skyline taucht alles ins Dunkel
Keine Liebe in diesem Dschungel

[Hook]
Ja, ich weiß, die Wahrheit tut weh
Doch ich muss jetzt weiter, okay?
Gib mir einen Song, den ich fühlen kann
Mir ist so wie Billie Holiday
Und Abschied nehm'n fällt mir nicht mehr schwer
Die Stadt so vergänglich und leer
Gib mir einen Song, den ich fühlen kann
Mir ist so wie „Bitte frag nicht wer“

[Part 2]
Zieh' meine Kreise von Yard zu Yard, muss Nacht für Nacht los
Es wird nie wieder sein, wie's mal war, Junge, lass los, lass los, lass los
Weiß manchmal selbst nicht mehr, was mich treibt, was bloß, was bloß?
Jag' ich nur nach verlorener Zeit, was macht mich so rastlos?
Hab' allen gesagt, allen gesagt, wer ich bin
Warum wisst ihr denn nicht, seht einfach nicht, wer ich bin?
Nicht das in mir, seht nicht das in mir, was ich bin
Tut mir leid, aber das macht alles kein'n Sinn

Mag deinen Style, kombinier' meinen dazu

Nein, habe keine Zeit für die Crew

Und kriegen von diesen Songs nie genug
Sade Adu „Give You The Sweetest Taboo“
Stimmt, wir kennen uns aus der tiefsten Platte
Seh' dich noch in Snow Jeans und der Pink-Windjacke
Alles kommt zurück, während ich mit dir chatte
Frag' mich grad, warum ich deinen Link nie hatte
War's nicht so: Deine Eltern haben dich vor mir gewarnt
Und du mich einen ganzen Sommer lang versetzt?
Doch es hat keine Bedeutung mehr, wenn du mich so anschaust
Dreht sich alles nur um Hier und Jetzt

Reden nicht von Exes, das tut nix zur Sache
Machst das Licht aus, während ich Musik anmache

Und mir ausgemalt, was ist, wenn ich dich treff'?
Und fühl' immer noch dasselbe, wenn du mich so ansiehst

Savage Mode II,,male,Intro,"[Intro: Morgan Freeman]
Great men with great ideals can be separated by hundreds or even thousands of miles and still be in the same place
They can be years or even generations apart in age
And yet, somehow, find themselves on the exact same page
When these men join forces to put the focus of reaching the same goals, to attain the same outcomes, they are not two, but one
Instead of simply adding one's common attributes to another's, they somehow tend to multiply all attributes of both
Whether from St. Louis or East Atlanta
Whether from a savage land or a booming metropolis
Whether they are two or two billion, the greatest their numbers could ever become, is to truly become one
I now present to you SAVAGE MODE II"
Savage Mode II,,male,Runnin,"[Intro: Diana Ross & 21 Savage]

I'm so rich, get bored, might wake up, buy me a car just 'cause (On God)
Her titties is hard 'cause she spent a five, my bitch titties cost me a dub (21)
All my bitches got BBLs, all my bitches got butts (Straight up)
I ain't with thе rap beef, Draco pedophile, all of my opps get touchеd (Straight up)
We ain't never ran off on no barber, but we still be hoppin' out cuts (Straight up)

[Chorus: 21 Savage]
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', runnin', I leave all my cars
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'

Glock in my lap, everywhere I'm strapped
Most these rappers cap, I ain't givin' dap

Way too many steppers, I can't hold 'em back
Body full of scars, face full of tats
You pray on your knees, I pray to my strap

Say you want smoke, but the fire come with it
Money on your head, nigga, we'll come get it
New Kel-Tec put a hun-dun in it
'Partment so sweet, threw a honey bun in it
Keep it in the street, I ain't doin' no squealin'
I don't never put women in my business
Full-time rapper, I ain't doin' no drillin'
Woah, woah, I can make a M in my sleep (Straight up)
17 breakin' down a P (On God)
18 start sellin' hard with Lil B
Hundred dollar three-five, a whip from D
Ridin' down Glenwood, tank on E
All about the money, I ain't never smoke weed
Cool young nigga, still take yo' cheese (Pussy)
Not mine, this bitch for us (21)
The gang is what I trust (Straight up)
Don't argue, we don't fuss (Straight up)
No talkin', he get touched (Straight up)
I can't smoke my opps (On God)
'Cause all my opps is dust (Pussy)

Holler something simple, talking 'bout the hood, fake like they hung in 'em
I got a million rhymes, want 'em? Come get 'em
What beef? These pussy niggas? Man, I'm just having fun with 'em



[Hook: T.I.]
Ayy, this a trap (C'mon)

[Verse 2: Mac Boney]
Still telling niggas, I ain't holding, I ain't folding
When the 12 hit the corner, I ain't rolling, I ain't rolling
Keep the coke stretched out like Carl Lewis' hamstrings
Stepped-on like I'm working with the dance team
Triple-beam ain't seen what I do to a ounce of blow
The wet man on my pager like, ""I'll pay you folks to whip some more""
I'm doper than the pure itself, I cook it all up by myself
I give my niggas recipes so they can turn to chefs theyself
They love the work, that's why I keep 'em coming like collection plates
We flip the cake then move this shit from Georgia, baby, state to state
Intimidate niggas in the city who been moving weight
Your pockets losing weight, they fuck with us 'cause you been known to hate
Demonstrate the way we turned the drought out in '98
It started out in '95, started out with nicks and dimes
Nigga, you done lost your mind, thinking you could set up shop
Pimpin', I respect the grind, let's take it to another block

[Verse 3: T.I.]
A nigga still in the trap when the spot'll seem hot
With the mayonnaise jar and the collard-green pot
On a lot of straight Hen' and a lot of green pot
Competition in a rage, like, ""he gotta be stopped""
Well, maybe I will be, but probably not
Oh, what the bloodclaat—he try, knock 'im out of he socks
Listen to I'm Serious, thinking, ""How did he not ...
End up way up on the top of the chart?""
That's because where I was, see, you gotta be pop
If you really want to pop, and I rather be dropped
Listen, Pops, want to know a little more about rap?
First rule: If it's real, it ain't just a record deal
It's a trap!"
Trap Muzik,,male,I Can't Quit,"[Intro]
Huh, Hell naww, I can't quit
Hell naww, man, we got too much money to be getting shot up
Stay down, Grand Hustle
Ugh

[Verse 1]
Look, I'm this far from being a star and just that close to quitting
I never should've came close to missing
But I want to be a musician, pimpin', not a politician
Listen, feel my position, it's a rough transition
Plus, I'm way too deep in the game to be trying to change
For fortune and fame and glamour, I could be in the slammer
Or six feet up under Atlanta—it's a blessing to breathe
I walk the streets with seven felonies, I'm blessed to be free
Long as somebody up in Heaven who keep blessing a G
T.I.P.'ll still be blessing CDs, so, haters, you can see these
'Cause I'm back now with something to prove
Everything to gain, pimpin', nothing to lose
I ought to start smacking niggas when it's nothing to do
They too big? Shoot them in the leg and even the odds
('Cause you ain't hard) 'less you ran with Cap and C-Rod
Trapped with K.T. and robbed with J.R.
Fucked hoes with D.P., broke bread with J.G.
Switched labels like K.P.
(Who the fuck did all that, pimp?) Me
Even though I'd rather go back to slanging drugs and shit
It's a gang of niggas and bitches really love this shit


[Hook: T.I.]
I can't quit
Even though polices hate I'm legit
And rappers hate it cause they know I'm the shit
Hell naww, I can't quit
Some niggas hating on the money I'm getting
Most of them hate it 'cause I'm fucking they bitches
Nah, pimpin', I can't quit
Some niggas hating on the rocks and the rings
Some of them hate 'cause they don't think I'm the King
Hell naww, I can't quit
People hate it when you better than them
They ain't hating? Start worrying, then
Ayy, I'm winning, I can't quit

[Verse 2: T.I.]
It's been... ten years, an album, and two deals
For real, we all know I should have sold two mil', at least
It's all good, though, I flow for the streets
I do it for y'all, every weekend—you see who in the mall
Who's still in the trap signing your shirts, giving you dap
Kicking it with you, then, get you and your folk in the club
Posing for pictures with girls, give them kisses and hugs
Pouring out liquor at shows, passing niggas the dro
One of the realest rappers niggas'll know
But niggas be hating to the point where they be calling the station (""Don't play his record"")
But they respect it 'cause I'm ready and focused
And I see they petty and bogus—I want you to know this
But most of you notice: Niggas in the game ain't real
Got to stay selling records 'cause the fame ain't shit
And fuck the units that they name'll sell
It'll break your heart to see your favorite rappers lame as hell
(Fuck them niggas! I'm the true and living!)


[Hook: T.I.]
I can't quit
Even though polices hate I'm legit
And rappers hate it 'cause they know I'm the shit
Hell naww, I can't quit
Some niggas hating on the money I'm getting
Most of them hate it 'cause I'm fucking they bitches
Nah, pimpin', I can't quit
Some niggas hating on the rocks and the rings
Some of them hate 'cause they don't think I'm the King
Hell naww, I can't quit
People hate it when you better than them
They ain't hating? Start worrying, then
Ayy, I'm winning, I can't quit

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Ayy, you can please some of the people some of the time
With some of your rhymes; but they might not like one of them lines
(I tell you what) I'll let you criticize me one at a time
Those of you who think I'm too cocky, get in front of the line
Whether you don't like my ego or my arrogant flow
Don't like that when you say I'm tight, I say, ""I already know""
Don't like how I was talking shit before my album could blow (Oh)
Like I need to calm it down, be more like the average Joe?
So, fuck you, them thoughts, and that lil' house you think I'm in
Get a Benz—I'll value your opinion then
Think I give a fuck how many times my record spins?
Fuck what you recommend, I'm back again!


[Hook: T.I.]
Look, pimpin', I can't quit
Even though polices hate I'm legit
And rappers hate it 'cause they know I'm the shit

Y—Yea—Y—a—Yeah
Y'all ain't never seen a dope boy play the piano and rap at the same time, have you?
I'ma show you something, partner!
Bop to the left and right like this here, nigga
Come on, homie!
Dig this!

[Verse 1]
I'm 22 and a vet in the game
Say I'm, I'm super cool, still a threat at the same time
Rhyme 'bout the times I invested in 'caine
Pleasure and pain in every aspect of the game
I'm the answer to your prayers if you praying for change
So, how dare you compare us and say we the same?
When I'm, I'm climbin' the ladder, they stuck in the same mindframe
They accomplishments are nothing to gain
And visually, see, I'm outta your range
Except this rose-gold glow from my wrist to my chain
I entertain young niggas who slang
Like a picture, no frame, see, it's simple and plain
Ayy, my shit bang, spit flames, put niggas to shame
Flow so insane, lyrics sick and deranged
Now, you can't mention my city 'less you mention my name
T.I., P-I-M-P, I'm the man (Ayy, ayy)



[Hook]
(Ayy, be easy) You don't want no trouble with me
(Just be easy) The drama ain't nothing to me
(Ayy, ayy, ayy, be easy) Before you having problems, just breathe
(Ayy, be easy) Ayy, you ain't worth dying, believe me
(Just be easy) You don't want your mama to grieve
(Be easy) Well, mind your busness, don't bother the G
(Ayy, ayy, be easy) Swear you stuntin' but you frontin' to me
(Just be easy) Behind the scenes or behind your breezes
Ayy, be easy

[Verse 2]
You came in kissing ass when I came to lead
Set the standard for Atlanta, rearranged the lead
Okay, so what the fuck is fame to me?
I been popping since kindergarten, you's a lame to me
I give the niggas what they came to see
A reflection of oneself—what they aim to be
As you can see, it ain't no change in me
And you won't meet another nigga off-the-chain as me
I'm so fly, no lie, don't deny it, you felt
So inspired by my style, decided to try it yourself
But you won't meet nobody ranked as high as myself
The checks you waiting on, homes, I can sign them myself
Tote gats, dro—smoked that—now, I'm high
Seats way back in the Maybach I ride
Through the streets of the westside, I slap five
And throw dubs, show love, nigga, hate me—why?


[Hook]
(Ayy, be easy) You don't want no trouble with me
(Just be easy) The drama ain't nothing to me
(Ayy, ayy, be easy) Before you having problems, just breathe
(Ayy, be easy) Ayy, you ain't worth dying, believe me
(Just be easy) You don't want your mama to grieve
(Be easy) Well, mind your busness, don't bother the G

Trap Muzik,,male,No More Talk,"[Verse 1]
I'm either running for my life or I'm just waiting to die
I'm the supplier of the fire if you're chasing a high
It's never when or why; it's the way that he die
Did he stand like a man 'til the day that he die?
Or was he reaching for guns or trying to run
Or was he outside on the lawn in front of his son
And if you running your mouth you can die in the slum
'Cause in the south where I'm from they dying for crumbs
You can die for your partners or die for your moms
Or you could die cause your nigga just heard the alarm, just stealing
Or die in a plane—they say it's a bomb
When they run it into a tower—they just say it's Saddam
Screaming Allah the moment that it's hitting the building
With total disregard for all men women and children
See niggas get killed when people mix they money with feelings
I'm filling my money up in the wall some in the ceiling
I'm just one of the millions of niggas who bucking
It's a war going on and they killing for nothing
We were in denial all awhile they where flicking the buttons
I'd rather be dying for something instead of living for nothing
End of discussion

[Hook]
Hey, ain't no more talk
Just start killing niggas off till ain't no more chalk
Or no mo' tape, to outline no mo' scenes
Or no mo' crimes, no mo' dying for no mo' fiends
Or no mo' rims and thing's and no mo' green
And no mo' chains and ring's that go bling bling
And no mo' passionate rapping and so it seems
It's just these talent less rappers they all acting
And I know, so ain't no mo' talk
Just start killing niggas off till ain't no mo' chalk
Or no mo' tape, to outline no mo' scenes
Or no mo' crimes, no mo' dying for no mo' phenes
Or no mo' rims and thing's and no mo' green
And no mo' chains and ring's that go bling bling
And no mo' passionate rapping and so it seems
It's just these talent less rappers they all acting
And I know

[Verse 2]
Yeah they said it wasn't no mo' green for no mo' grind
No mo' room for no mo' kings and no more crown to be given but by no means
Am I any more conceited than this game needed
And if I say it believe it, I'm running the region, you see it
Popping and blowing, I'm stopping I'm going
I'm just, telling, you knowing, you sleeping, or hating
And I don't care what you niggas is thinking or saying
About, you know who, the one who say you know what, do you know where
But you the best cuz you goin' care
Now I ain't think so either, but we know greed'll make ya
Do strange thang's if we ain't people
And if ya, busting bout nothing, than we ain't equal
You just cussing for nothing and poisoning people
And it's embarrassing laughing at all of your songs
And you can hate me right now but you'll miss me 'fore long, when I'm gone

Trap Muzik,,male,Doin' My Job,"[T.I. - talking]
Ay I'm working here, know what I'm saying
Try to put yourself in my shoes for a second
Its not personal I'm just sayin though

[Verse 1]
Ay look
From when the moon came out 'till the sun came up
I was supplyin' the days when where they flame up
Our mamas passing, by trying to explain us
Pissing in the bushes like they never house trained us
But, try to understand thats how we came up
You get to know us, you'll love us but you can't change us (naw)
Really we rather be rich and famous
But in the mean time were forced to slang dust
'Dro or crack cocaine, Penicillin to Rogaine
Ecstacy, Viagra, whatever'll get the dough mayne
I'm tired of people misrepresenting my domain
Oh you think we out here killing for nothing, hustlin for no gain (picture that)

[Chorus] (sample playing in the background)
Hey man I'm just doing my job
Hey lady, don't mind me I'm just doing my job
I don't wanna make your life more harder, I'm just doin my job
You live here, I work here I'm doing my job



[Verse 2]
I don't know if you don't know, don't care or can't see
Every time something up in the hood, it ain't me
And I ain't always up to no good and on the creep
So you ain't always gotta pass through the hood without speaking (how you doin'?)
We ain't out here threatening your lives, raping your children
We just out here staying alive, making a million (you know)
Working hard, trying to survive chasing a million
You hear us talking loud, just think of us as chameleons
Adapting to situations, but accusations of stealing
And burglarizing your house, I mean you just hurting my feelings
We got lives, we wanna live nice too
We got moms, dads, wives, kids just like you
But our options are few, it's hell in high school
When your helping with the rent lights and the gas bill too
So before you go judging us loving us won't hurt
When you're under 25, staying alive's hard work

[Chorus] (sample playing in the background)
Hey man I'm just doing my job
Hey lady, don't mind me I'm just doing my job
I don't wanna make your life more harder, I'm just doin my job
You live here, I work here I'm doing my job

[Verse 3]
And for you to see what I'm saying, open eyes will help
If you could think about somebody besides yourself
Why you pointing fingers at me, analyze yourself
Quit all that chastising and try to provide some help
Instead of calling the law and busting my balls
With all due respect, we don't even be fucking with y'all (maan)
And we can't help it cause it is like this
We don't like it no more than you that we live like this
Always stuck in the grind, summertime to wintertime
Cutting school to sell fifty dimes by dinner time
See everything we know we learned from the streets
Since thirteen I've been hustling and earning my keep


[Chorus] (sample playing in the background)
Hey man I'm just doing my job
Hey lady, don't mind me I'm just doing my job
I don't wanna make your life more harder, I'm just doin my job
You live here, I work here I'm doing my job"

Comment faire face à la bête ? Chien de l'enfer à deux têtes (deux têtes)
J'investis tôt dans les narco, j'veux voir ton clito dans le Merco
J'ai du sirop dans le Chardonnay, t'as les chicots dans le verre d'eau
Sachet dans le cartonné, de la barbe jusqu'au nez
Ne sait pas pardonner, zoner, ber-bar tu nous connais
J'veux la vie belle j'suis un criminel, femelle, j'te crache sur le Rimmel
Approche de mes décibels, j'brûle comme le soleil, tu repars t'as le cul qui pèle
Y'a de la coke sur leurs Mickeys, éteignez vos briquets
Attends la lumière du jour, tu vas voir leur crâne sur un piquet
J'dois finir ma cassette, vider le AK-47
Sans tacher mes frelons et mon nouveau polo EA7
Z'ont du retard sur le flow, z'ont du retard sur les instrus
Et j'leur baise tellement leur daronne qu'elles ont même du retard sur leurs menstrues
J'veux la gagne, macaque sur le macadam, j'suis pas glam', pas glam'
J'râpe mon arme sur la colonne vertébrale, de la came, de la came, au gramme, au gramme
Je la crame, je la crame, j'balance du Napalm ou ma tatane-tatane
Frappe sale dans la transversale, j'suis de Paname comme Zlatan, Zlatan
Teushi nouvel arôme, de-spee j'roule un cône
J'sais que tu m'aimes pas, tends-moi encore ta putain d'main j'te chie sur la paume
Plaide pour moi, ils te répondront c'est un morche
Il ne fait qu'du sale il veut rien savoir il est pire que Guy Georges
Poids lourd contre trisomique, à la pesée des kilos
Tu vois flou, gant noir sur automatique au lever du rideau
C'est dans ton bonda que j'déferle, ça te dérange mais tu fermes ta gueule
Tu restes àl', tu prends sur oit', comme quand l'daron lâche des perles
J'veux les voir ramper, en me suppliant, j'kiffe
Nan en fait je les veux morts, avec supplément frites
J'suis capable du meilleur, comme du pire

Lamborghini Diablo avec Nafissatou Diallo
Alpha mâle reproducteur si t'as envie d'sexe
Main sur ta schneck, l'autre sur mon Ruger : j'suis ambidextre
Tu seras meilleur que nous quand les ours polaires seront en nage
L'argent tombera du ciel quand le string des strip-teaseuses seront trop larges
Ma clique est algérienne-sénégalo-ivoiro-malienne
Je chante mon hymne à la tienne, la puissance est himalayenne, himalayenne

Du marbre sous les pieds on en rêve tous mais pour l'instant
Pour le crack c'est sous l'évier, et la barbe est sous le keffieh
Du marbre sous les pieds on en rêve tous mais pour l'instant
Pour le crack c'est sous l'évier, et la barbe est sous le keffieh

[Couplet 1]
Même au bord du gouffre, j'tends pas la main à mon pire ennemi
Souffrance et douleur sont dans mes disques comme une hernie
T'emportes rien du tout même si tu coffres et qu'tu fais belhani
Ça marche pas comme faire ses ablutions avec du vernis
Du big-bang à Mac Doom, puisqu'elle est tatouée sur sur sa choun
L'État Major à Khartoum, j'suis armé comme un pachtoune
Ce n'est que l'préambule, j'avance comme la péninsule
Jeune noir traverse le fil de la vie comme un funambule
Maman tu pleures sans fin, je sais même plus si tu souris
Tous tes fils ont faim, mais les tirs sont nourris
Carence affective, enfance difficile
Dans la ville que pour l'argent facile

J'sais pas si le pire c'est que les narcotiques s'introduisent
Ou si le plus dangereux soit que les Sarkozy se reproduisent
J'suis sur un gros biz', j'me moque qu'on m'applaudisse
Et si tu portes un micro, alors c'est mon Glock qui improvise
On t'douille à vue direct, en France pas d'diplôme dans nos zones
Des couilles négro, X Y grâce à la danse des chromosomes
Tout en haut du building, tu peux te retrouver à six pieds
Rien n'est acquis, le chasseur peut devenir le gibier
Si je vous ai ratés, sachez que je voulais vous caner
Un flic noir, zélé : j'en fait du poulet boucané
J'y pense tous les jours de l'année, donc je voulais vous parler
Vous dire qu'on est tous damnés, amenés à être armés

La barbe est sous le keffieh, pour le crack c'est sous l'évier

Holigan,,male,İlk Adım (Intro),"[Verse]
İlk adım bu, sırattayım yine
Zar zor başarıyorum bu albümü çıkartmayı, kime anlatıyorum bunu?
Son birkaç ay öyle bunaldım ki inan uzaklaşıp düşünmüştüm bırakmayı bile

Fakat başarmaktan başka şansım yoktu, yere basamıyodum
Tam altı ay kafayı yedim istediğimi yazamıyodum
Bunalıyodum, içimdeki eksik neydi bulamıyodum
Herkes birden peşime düştü çünkü para kazanıyodum
Azalıyodu vakit, dedim ‘bitti yolun buraya kadarı n’oldu rape sarılıp titriyodun?’
Hala hırsla müzik yapmak istiyodum
Ayakta kalıcam evet, hiçbir yere gitmiyorum

Hiphop varsa olumsuzdu rapor
Neden diyorlardı ""müziği bırak bi baltaya sap ol""
Peki ‘bi baltaya sap ol’ ne demek, anlamıyorum bunu
Sanki müziği bıraksam gidip parçalayacaktım atom

Gözlerimle gördüklerim benim değil zaten hayat oldum olası böyledir
Ben istesem de istemesem de sürekli bir yerlerde şarkılarım söylenir
Kefil benim, gözünü kapat
Emin ol ki bugüne kadar böyle bi' şey görmedin
Hip-Hop hala hayatta, Hip-Hop hala yaşıyor, çünkü henüz ölmedim

Holigan,,male,Kriz Gibi Geri Geldim,"[Intro]
Hidra, 2014, kriz gibi geri geldim, bitches, yeah
Burası dünya değil, burası dünya değil, burası dünya değil

[Verse 1]
Burası dünya değil benim gezegenim, egoların ezilebilir bu da işin ticareti
Rüya değil, seni saman alevine bile söndürebilirler için bir lanetin
Süryani gibi şarap içerim adım bir sanat eseri, bu boku içip firar edin
Düşman bil beni bu seviye size göre değil aga, bu arada sikeyim siyaseti

Küstah piç Rap'i hatim ediyorum ama, sen daha yeni yeni bitirdin ayeti
Süvari ordularını getir hadi, kesme de toparla bütün vilayeti
Rüya kim hangi kokoş duydu ki, kulakta böyle bi' ritim ziyafeti?
Gün tarih yazma günüdür artık, içinde tutma ve tükür kitâbeni

Üstat değil daha bebe tabi tabi seni Teletubbie diyor, tabi şükür ki daha yeni
Düz yaz şiirini demagoji bir stile, sarılarak sat ama düşük hikayeni
Düz bar diss ya da bok atalım hadi diyo'n ama, yıkamazsın büyük bir mabedi
Hüsran değil benim diğer adım ona göre, sen saldır yine büyür dirayetim

Hünkar kim, hadi piyasanın ateşini yakamadı biri bile düşüktü rağbeti
Gül kalbim bir gün duracağız ama şu an reddedemiyorum küçük bir daveti
Dünya kin dolu bana depoladı bunu, ona soka soka bunu çürüttüm aleti
Türkan değil la bu yeraltı mehteri, sövüyorum ama yok RTÜK şikayeti

[Hook x2]
Bur'dayken, her cepheden gel
Birleşsin bence bedenler
Ben hala sakinim, hala seyrediyo'm sizi pencerelerden
Saldırmamı bekleme benden, mağlupsun tek denemenden
Hala çok sakinim, hala seyrediyo'm sizi pencerelerden
Ben bur'dayken, her cepheden gel
Birleşsin bence bedenler
Ben hala sakinim, hala seyrediyo'm sizi pencerelerden
Saldırmamı bekleme benden, mağlupsun tek denemenden
Hala çok sakinim, hala seyrediyo'm sizi pencerelerden


[Verse 2]
Adım Hidra, peki sana gereken kim?
Bana gereken, benim bana gene kendim
Bunu gergin yüz ifadelerimden çözdüm
Geri geldim, ben bir elementim

Ametal değil elederdim
Denemem bir senelerdir
Gene sertim, yere serpil, gidip ele kerkin
Ben bir hedefe bin kere denemem ki

Yara berelendim, kaç sene verdim
Kaç kere dedim öfkemi yenemem ki
Bak kulakta MMLP, gene pertim
Adım duyuldu ve bir anda lekelendim

Bak oradaki bebeler kimleri dinliyor
Sikimde değil de, gel bunu dene kendin
Ama yeme kendini
Hiç kaliteyi çekmiyor şebeken ki

Deniyorsun olayıma geç, şimdi kitlemi duydu bu kitleyi her özenti
Uyduruk işleri, duygulu dissleri, el öpen kim? Size veto verdim
Duygulu sistemin uykusu bitmedi. Her ölen değil, di mi pek önemli?
Beni susturun iyice ve durdurun istedim. Yap bana diss bir fenomen değil


Ama kurgulu tipleri, ünlü tripleri, süslü kliplerine söven kim?
Kes buldunuz işte bu laneti, çok gaza gelme de dur bu sömür ölenti
Çok duydunuz ismimi, kuytu bir risk gibi. Hem de kriz gibi geri geldim
Son duyurumu yapıyorum, çık arenaya kalk bak tabelaya bak, yenilen kim?

Yoksa sebep bul, 10 nota bez bul

Dünyanın dertleri pespembeyken, ne demem dertleri mesken
Ruhlarımız kıtlıktayken, geçici hevesler fertleri besler
Bundandır karamsar olmaya başladı giderek, her yeni bestem
Çok mutsuzsun bence, sigarayı bırak ve dengeli beslen

Ha siktir, her gece buraları “terk et” diyor bana, perdeli sesler
Peki nerede bu gezegen derken, birileri tezden “gel” dedi resmen
Gidemem yok, yer mi be desten de beter bir yerde serseri tezler
Bir de ben çok geldim hevesten, belki gelirim ama her yeri gezmem

Bir soru gibi soruluyorum, yok cevabım inadına soruluyorum
Ben öyle bir nefrete sahip sanki, bu gezegenin havasını solumuyorum
Bir tarafım ölü gibi yazıyor ve tıkanıyor solunum yolu ve yine yoruluyorum
Bu gezegen hasta bir fahişe egoları bulaşıcı, bundan korunuyorum

Kan gözyaşı bile, dansöz başı gibi dönüyor da iyi değil sonu bu yolun
Hadi sömür onu, gözü kömür onun ölü dolu bir mezarın adını da o buluyordur
Yine geldim ve gezegenin esiriyim, kendim dışında kimseyi korumuyorum
Bu gezegen bok gibi yeter artık lan, buradan ne zaman kovuluyorum?

Uyan, uyan
Yeni bir düş yakar aklından
Yine gökyüzü karanlık, yine zararlı, yine kararlı
Zamanla kazandık kalk

[Verse 2]
Sundum dert ikilemleri gerdi ve onlardan biri, belki de bendim
Bulduğum bir kalemle yazıyorum o denli yarın bu terkib-i bendi
Durdurdum terk edilenleri, her biri dertli ve pek bir kederli
Soldurdum renkli bedenleri, zevki seven seni tebrik eder mi?

Seni bir kere yakından tanıyan birisi, hiç ölüme tehlike der mi?
Al hadi zehrimi sök dik hemen git, hep mi köreldik dip dibe geldik
Olmasaydı felaketlerin, korkmaz çoktan tehdit ederdik
Seni biz bitirdik, sen de ödeştin ve bence bu kadar tepki yeterli

N’olur bir daha gelemezsem, ya da gelip de yine seni yenemezsem. Ha?
N’olur bir daha sevemezsem seni, kendimi yine sana veremezsem. Ha?
N’olur bir daha denemezsem, bunu yoluna hayalleri seremezsem. Ha?
N’olur hadi bunu bana göster gel, cesaretim büyük Everest’ten

Zorlama oyununa gelemem ben, son dileklerini gel dile benden
Gitmem gerekirken beni tuttun, tuhaftı ruhumu ele vermen
Güneşi yarattım gecelerden gelir, elbet bir gün de ecel erken
O zaman kahkaha atarak boşluğa doğru yürüce'm gezegenden

Got no time for rest
Got two babies strapped to either breast
Know my baby daddy so depressed
It's been way over a decade
And he still a mess
Still a nasty nigga
He like girls who got a curfew
Can't wait for the universe to smoke you
Pray yo son ain't never nothin like you
Caught him watching porn

Lookin at the old me in the mirror
Bouta hit a lick
I miss that bitch sometimes
She with the shit
Remember when them bitches jumped me in the gym
With all they friends

Watching little brittnee catch another win
Love a bitch or hate her
But you really can't debate it
I'm that nigga
And i'm realer than the bitches in the back
And i'm tired of being humble
I'm taking my niggas with me
You ain't fuckin with me now
Then bitch you might as well forget me

If you ever crossed me, fuck it
I dont have no hate for you
I pray for you

Won't you beat me to the bank
Why my attitude so stank
Really ain't
I'm just sick of niggas judging me
Nudging me
Tryna make me be who i don't wanna be
Open up they mouth and all these niggas get is nuts from me

Fuck it my Glock pretty like a girl
She let me finger bang
Skeet all on my latest hater face
She can't afford to hang
Kick these bitches out
They pray for clout
Choke all on my name
Kick these bitches out
They pray for clout
Choke all on my name
Yea


Hook:

Tired of actin like i ain't the shit
Bitch i'm out here in the sewers with a brick

Masturbating thru the pressure

Never love em

Yea
Hello, is anyone there?
Mama, you look like a rockstar

[Verse 1: bbymutha]
Yea, I'm so fuckin’ fye, my inner actions give 'em satisfaction
They want attention, they want mention
Bitch, I'm really crackin’
She talkin' shit, she need a hit, uh oh, I caught her lackin'
Now she leakin', get that bitch a pad, she fuckin' up mattress
Most my haters really just auditionin', she such an actress
How that bitch gon' act when I pull up? On go for target practice
I'm a little rusty, snortin’ dusty but I’m 'bout that action
Rarely off of dander, I ain’t crazy, I'm just full of passion
Bad for business, I can't fuck with bitches who got hate all in they calendar
Pocket rocket, make yo hoе relax, I call her lavendеr
Cut it out, can't see how you hatin’ from the passenger
You can't move 'til other niggas move
I gotta laugh at ya

[Chorus: bbymutha]
Yeah, do what I want
Fuck you bitch, this my house
You don't pay no bills out here
Don't make me knock them lights out
Yeah bitch, do what I want
Fuck you bitch, this my house
You don't pay no bills out here
Don't make me knock them lights out
Yeah bitch, do what I want
Fuck you bitch, this my house
You don't pay no bills out here
Don't make me knock them lights out
Yeah bitch, do what I want
Fuck you bitch, this my house
You don't pay no bills out here
Don't make me knock them lights out


[Verse 2: ttybby]
I'm from the hood, we was on bikes
Throw them hoes down and go get a drink
I'm from the hood where we don't think
I'm from the hood, we all got shrinks
Do what I want, buy what I want
That dope they smokin', they got it from T
I got hoe things, I do tend to cheat
I look both ways 'fore I cross the street
I say what I want, fuck how they feel
Fuck what they say, it don't stop pay
Buy what I want, that job shit lame
I couldn't buy shit off minimum wage
I had a strap, went got a scale
Went got a pack and then got paid
It ain't no take, it ain't no wait
Time don't waste I just make plays
Still in the spot, it's in the hood
I got three bands, KKK
These niggas used to be knockout cleans
But now niggas hoes and won't take fade
So do what you want, I'ma be straight
I'ma keep mine in the business that pay
I'ma keep fuckin' the one you call bae
I slay, I told you I do what I want
You knew it


[Chorus: bbymutha]
Yeah, do what I want
Fuck you bitch, this my house
You don't pay no bills out here
Don't make me knock them lights out
Yeah bitch, do what I want
Fuck you bitch, this my house
You don't pay no bills out here
Don't make me knock them lights out
Yeah bitch, do what I want
Fuck you bitch, this my house
You don't pay no bills out here
Don't make me knock them lights out
Yeah bitch, do what I want
Fuck you bitch, this my house

Don't make me knock them lights out"

Wie Is Guy?,,male,Wie Is Guy?,"[Strofe 1: Zwangere Guy]
Oh shit
Guy doe die zaken die jullie niet doen
29 en al op pensioen
Z'n shit is zo dope en z'n shit is zo (ooh)
Dokter Guy is weer op onderzoek
Broekje af, slipje uit
Dames zetten wij niet voor de ruit
Geen boekentas, nee hij oefent thuis
Als Guy wilt poes, speelt hij kat en muis
De Guy is zo gaar en de Guy is zo cool
Dit is Thanksgiving met kalkoen
Sippin' Tanqueray, gin and juice
Dit is pijnstillers na de booze
Fatsoenlijke G's zeggen ""voulez-vous""
Uw shit is zwak en wij doen ertoe
TDE, Kendrick, ScHoolboy Q
Zet gee is loco en dat geeft hij toe
Guy doet die zaken gelijk een boss
Guy is kok, hij maakt de beste saus
Guy is boos soms, Guy is stout
Guy gaat dansen op die acid-house
Holger Czukay, cool in the pool
100 push-ups zonder doel
Energuy met de G-U-Y
Als Guy is hier, wilt hij wier en bier


[Refrein: Zwangere Guy]
Guy doet die shit to the dawn
Guy doet die shit al zo lang
Guy zit niet stil op de bank
Guy doet die zaak als een baas
El jefe, el jefe
Allemaal zien ze Guy als de gekste
Heel effe, heel effe
Allemaal willen met de Guy flexen
Oh shit

[Strofe 2: Zwangere Guy]
Wie is Guy? Wie is Guy?
Guy is die G die da jij nie zie
Whiskey hier voor die ultieme G
Japanse shit, Yamazaki
Yama wa? Ja maar qui?
Lamme Guy in de place to be
Liters bier met wijn en wier
Guy smoken van die gekke cheese
Dit is token, tot ge niest
Guy ziet spoken, is een gekke G
Alleen klassiekers All Eyez On Me
Luister Tupac, jullie Britney Spears
Ze praten boos maar ze pushen niks
Papa zet gee op een koppel bricks
BlaBlaCar direction Paris
De helft uit Brussel die rapt als een bi


[Skit: Miss Angel]
Mhm mhm mhm
Fuck you Guy, gij egocentrische motherfucker
Altijd maar bezig over hoe goe dat gij zijt
Fuck that shit boy, volgende keer als gij mij ziet
You betta holla at me
Oh shit

[Strofe 3: Zwangere Guy]
Guy is stipt al de rest te traag
De tijd tikt door, jullie zijn te laat
Guy zit in de lift, gij gaat naar omlaag
Smoke een dikke spliff op een volle maag
Marvin Gaye, Marvin Guy
Move on up, baby let it be
Ze weten wat hij doet en wat hij wilt
Pas tevreden vanaf alles blinkt
De patta's vers, die van u die stinkt
De kassa hier die zegt altijd tsjing
Y semballe les couilles van wat dat gij vindt
Guy is loco maar wel goed gezind
Rare motherfucker net een kind
Guy gelooft nog altijd in de Sint
Guy is dom en al de rest is slim
Guy is blond enneuh

[Strofe 4: Zwangere Guy]
Egocentrische vuile zak
Guy die denkt alleen aan zijn gemak
Hij kan niet rijmen en zijn shit is zwak
Hij loopt al jaren in hetzelfde pak
Z'n eerste wagen reed hij in de prak
Z'n platen vindt ge zelf nie bij de Fnac
Hij doet alsof en hij is achterbaks
Guy de klootzak van de eerste plank
Rookt altijd wiet en hij zit aan de drank
Hij zegt van niet en hij ontkent de stank
Zijn eerste lief heeft hem afgedankt
Wilt altijd beef, ja de Guy is krank
Domme motherfucker zonder doel
Zit op den dop en hij vindt dat cool
Zijn naam een flop en hij vindt hem zwoel
Wie dees gelooft, ja dat is een fool

I'm a fool to you

'We willen altijd stoer zijn en leuk zijn en, en sterk zijn, en dus gaan we ons afsluiten en inbunkeren voor de liefdevolheid. Onze maatschappij lijkt door te schieten, denk ik, in ikkig-heid. In een overgewaardeerd denken van autonomie.’

Dagen dat ik werk
Dagen dat ik slaap
Dagen dat ik wens
Dagen dat ik haat
Dagen in mezelf
Stond dagen in de kou
Dagen dat ik denk (hm) dat ik warmer wou
Jaren op de werf
Stond jaren in de bouw
Jaren dat ik merk (hm) dat ik da nie wou
Heb maten en respect
Een vrouw van wie ik hou
Kijk, later is te ver want vroeger was te flauw

[Verse 1]
Het lijkt als lang geleden toch ligt het zo dichtbij
Wie dacht dit was voor even, die zat ernaast (bah oui!)
Shit ligt gevoelig hier
Houden het graag charmant
Hebben het graag contant
Houden het graag plezant
Ons moet ge nie zeggen hoe da het hier werkt en wa wij moeten doen (wacht)
Spel ons nie de les, beslissen wel zelf
We zetten de stad op de map
De staat die fuckt ons up
Heb een cijfer op m’n kop
ACAB elke focking cop
En dat is wat ik denk ervan


Dit is wat ik doe, dit is wat ik kan
Dit is wat ik voel, dat is wat ik zou
Dit is ondergronds, dit is onder ons
Fuck de hele staat, ikke leef en sta
Waar da ikke wil, dat is hoe het zit
Ikke zit nie stil daarom da ik spit

Rollen door de wijk met de squad
Dit is Brussel all day elke nacht
Rollen van de trein, van de tram
Rollen nog een dikke heb een gram in de hand

Lange dagen dat ik werk (dagen dat ik dikke smoke)
(Alle dagen met m'n broeders, alle dagen met m'n bro's)
Oow, ik heb iets anders aan m'n hoofd

(Ja, check, oké nog eens)

Blijven lopen door de stad
Elke dag en elke nacht
Bon bref, fin, soit
Soms def, soms zat
Dit is al dat ik doe
Dit is all that I got
Nope ik maak me nie meer moe
Heb het allemaal gehad
Cannonball Adderley
Dave Brubeck op de keys
Lander Gyselinck op de beat
LeFtO samen met de Guy
Fucken de wet en the system
Ikke ga jazzen als Bilzen
Nemen ne slok van die pilsner
Hebben geen tijd te verspillen
Ik heb het, ik kan het, ik wil dit
Al jaren ben ik in de building
Purple Rain op m'n Prince shit
Geen Big Boi wel een misfit
De staat is ziek
De staat is zot
Ik wil geen politiek meer op mijn bord

Wie Is Guy?,,male,Brussels State Of Mind,"Keep it old school op m'n Wu Tang Clark Wallabee's
Hou het vies, keep it real, dat is mijn advies
Van '88 gelijk een trench coat van Burberry's
Mijn mannen blazen kush, jullie roken seeds
F* want Guy die wilt zijn royalties
Heb loyal G's, zetten de puntjes altijd op de i's
L-O-W-G-I-S eh shit is altijd lowgisch hier
Kijk, een G die te veel stresst is overbodig hier
Ze verkopen hier hun ziel voor wat gekleurd papier
Guy kruipt in zijn pen en voert die polemiek
Ik hou het old school gelijk een goeie Geuze of oude Kriek
Kom uit een wijk waar dat zwijgen ook een pluim verdient
Snitch niet of we zetten u in diskrediet
Switch please, uw gedachtengang verstaan we niet
Dit hier, goeie wirrie en een dikke beat
Guy squeezt zich ertussen op de business seat

Beter ge past op met wat ge doet hier
Hier is er altijd wel een G die op de loer ligt
Ge wilt die cool shit, leven als een movie
Beter ge relaxt en ge rookt u nog een doobie

Kansen blijven komen, maar de focus die verdwijnt
Ge moet werken voor uw brood, is wat mijn vader altijd zei
Blijf ganse dagen dromen, voor ik weet ben ik ze kwijt
Heb chance gehad en verloren maar dat hoort er altijd bij
Door de ene man zijn dood, krijgt de ander zijn ontbijt
Ken mannen van hun woord en ik ken mannen vol gezeik
Zit met plannen in m'n hoofd, maar ben de vijzen al lang kwijt
Zet mij 10 jaar in de shit en tegen dan ben ik de geit
La vida loca, ik heb die Brussels state of mind
Bakken Saltimbocca alsof ik was een Italiaan
Noem mij Tony Toca Puerto Rico ay papa
Jullie snuiven coca, omdat het anders niet meer gaat
Hoe dan ook, geef geen fuck dat is wat ik altijd doe
BXL tot de dood en dat telt voor heel de crew
Who dat boy on the block?
1000 Brussel City
Neem een slok, rook het op tot dat ik hier niets meer voel

Beter ge past op met wat ge doet hier
Hier is er altijd wel een G die op de loer ligt
Ge wilt die cool shit, leven als een movie
Beter ge relaxt en ge rookt u nog een doobie

C'est pour les têtes brulées
Les purs, les durs, les ...
Ze willen vlammen maar hebben nooit geen vuur mee
Ik bestuur dees, organiseer het buurtfeest
Zie me nie meer in de club, tenzij ik er een uur speel
Fuck een showcase, Guy is zo brood deeg
Kwaliteit voor kwanti, de manier waarop ik doorbreek
Dit is los gehen, platen op de schoorsteen
De helft van wat ik hoor, vind ik standaard altijd doorsnee
Diegene die willen die mogen die kunnen proberen te testen
Brussel de stad van de grootste, de hardste, de wildste, de beste
Ze schrijven, ze bellen, ze mailen, ze sturen, ze willen connecten
Ik en mijn clique verleggen de grens en blijven hard werken
Hier vlamt de shit altijd ietske langer
Woon al 30 jaar in 't stad ben amper iets veranderd
Kijk, ik zeg niet dat ik de beste ben
Niet dat ik het snelste ren
En toch heb ik de scherpste pen"
