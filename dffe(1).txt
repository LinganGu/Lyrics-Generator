Es ist hell           es ist laut
Es ist kalt           ich wach' auf

Ich zähle acht
Augen                 mir sind alle fremd
Ich les' das
Plastikbändchen an

                      nur gebettet im
Karim Martin          Hermelin-Umhang
                      vier verdammte
53 Zentimeter         Kilogramm
Mir fällt es schwer
zu atmen              doch ein Engel kommt
                      solang bis ich schlafe
Und hält mich in den wie ein Junk auf
Armen                 Codein
Ich wache auf in      die bei weitem zu klein um sich dort wohl zu
einer Wohnung         ist                       fühl'n
                      um dort ohne Flous
Doch anscheinend zwei Kinder
groß genug ist        großzuzieh'n
Ich träume von rotenwährend ich in mei'm

Denn Mama geht's
nicht gut in diesen
Zeiten
Baba geht's nicht     zum Verstecken ist die
besser                Bude viel zu klein
Deswegen halt' ich
meiner Schwester
die Ohren zu          wenn sie streiten
Ich lass' die Augen
ruh'n und schlafe
ein und werde wach
in einem
Klassenzimmer
Von dem lauten
Lachen von
achtzehn Kindern
Die mir mit ihren
blassen Fingern
durch die Locken
streifen
Verschwind' aufs      wo ich dann meine
Klo                   Tränen trocken reibe
                      den nächsten Pisser
Und mir schwör'       knock' ich einfach        fuck it

Kurz darauf schickt

Gumbo?
Hello!
Are you talkin’ about

Ay you know I think

singing than talking
Why don’t we sing a
song?

Verse Pink Siifu
See this right here

Say I ain’t been here

But I seen it all         that shit
How she built it all
from the ground up
Nigga got ?

I remember ?
We used to smile
We was kids               little babes    runnin’ round
All this love let it fall
from the road
All this love let it
pray for ?
So if you see us
running down too

Move that ass

Big Rube               Pink Siifu          Gumbo
We do it for the folks
So they can
continue to hold on
For the ?
Can’t be scared to ?
For all the faces we
put smiles on
And all the places
we’ve gone
Travelled miles too
long                   to count
But what matters
isn’t the amount
But the quality of the
message and sound
And I can tell you for
sure
We keepin’ it one
We stay tapped in to
the end from day
one
Got love from older
folks down to the
youth
Just let the record
play and let the
songs be living proof
Can’t stop the truth

We pull up on BMX
bikes like the Fab 5
So I walked up in
the mall right         did the swipe               swipe
Then I gave away
my Moncler in the
sacrifice
It's kinda funny
'cause you're so
mad and IDGAF
I just wanna have
fun
Im switching styles
up with the season
Need no reason to      I just do whatever I like
Too many times
they tried to do me
dirty
Make me feel like
I'm not worthy of
what I've got
You've gotta keep a
very calm
composure
Strong and sober       I'll do whatever I like

Verse
Greatness for us
If you believe in luck
Trust the sacred
Oh                     just a touch            it's not enough
A place beyond the
lust and temptations
of love
Complete
annihilation of us
Walk in light           see with anothеr eye
SG                      we fortifiеd
I've been down bad
trying to get back up
Had to make it
worse                   even more so
So                      when I'm at my lowest     there's no other way
I'd only go up          I hope it's so
Fear of death and
stress causes stress
and fear of death
I can't lie             I must confess
Fear of death and
stress causes stress
and fear of death
I'm tryna see it as a
test
                        please god may you
I'm praying to God bless me (Please God)
Still the same me
but                     baby                      lately I've been messy
I must forgive myself
before you can even
forgive me
The shell is pretty the Devil's busy
                        looks desperately for a   it's trials and tribulation
Oh                      sign                      time
The brave attempt he tries to take
fails and falls flat    everything back
He's sure that
something will go and that makes
wrong                   everything go wrong
But still the hope it's
strong (The road is
long you must go
on)

Ich bleib' mir treu   folge niemanden           alles Schall und Rauch
                      das Kush und die
Den Traum             Lilanen                   hab' alles                was ich brauch'
Wach' auf am          greif' unters Bett nach
Abend                 den Ultra Boosts
Muss wieder los       wenn die Straße ruft      hab' den Walkin' Blues
Und würde alles       wenn morgen alles
wieder so tun         vorbei wär'
Diese Nächte und      diese Feste bedeuten
Bilder dazu           mir weit mehr
Ein Hoch auf die      die immer da war'n        auch wenn ich scheiter'
                      wenn Dämonen über
                      mir kreisen und zieh'
Denk' an euch         einfach weiter


Pre-Hook
Hab' mein Zuhause such' nach 'nem neuen
verlor'n           Zuhause
Und auch wenn sich
hier alles gleicht egal                     wohin ich auch laufe
                   die Skyline taucht alles
Sonne geht auf     ins Dunkel
Keine Liebe in
diesem Dschungel

Hook
Ja                     ich weiß                 die Wahrheit tut weh
Doch ich muss jetzt
weiter                 okay?
Gib mir einen Song den ich fühlen kann
Mir ist so wie Billie
Holiday
Und Abschied
nehm'n fällt mir nicht
mehr schwer
Die Stadt so
vergänglich und leer
Gib mir einen Song den ich fühlen kann
Mir ist so wie „Bitte
frag nicht wer“

Part 2
Zieh' meine Kreise    muss Nacht für Nacht
von Yard zu Yard      los
Es wird nie wieder
sein                  wie's mal war             Junge                     lass los          lass los   lass los
Weiß manchmal
selbst nicht mehr     was mich treibt           was bloß                  was bloß?
Jag' ich nur nach     was macht mich so
verlorener Zeit       rastlos?
Hab' allen gesagt     allen gesagt              wer ich bin
Warum wisst ihr
denn nicht            seht einfach nicht        wer ich bin?
Nicht das in mir      seht nicht das in mir     was ich bin
                      aber das macht alles
Tut mir leid          kein'n Sinn

The heat
It's comin' down
hard
We’ve got to get our
shit together

Chorus: Q-Tip &
Phife Dawg
It’s time to go left
and not right
Gotta get it together
forever
Gotta get it together
for brothers
Gotta get it together
for sisters
For mothers and
fathers and dead
niggas
For non-conformists
For Tyson types and
Che figures
Let’s get it together
Gotta make it to
make it
To make something
happen
To make something

Verse 1: Q-Tip &
Jarobi
Word to Phifer
Gonna bring it to the
overlord
Chilling with the gold
microphone cords
And we grip our
balls every time we
stuntin' on tour
Cause we never
bore
And promoters try to
hit us with the art of
war
We about our
business
Not bullshitters
Don’t be bitter
'cause we not just
niggas
Jarobi
Ain’t nothing
forbidden
Hardest spit in the
city y’all niggas
spitting kitten soft
Confused and
amazed
They planning for
our future
None of our people
involved
Pouring Henny and
Smirnoff to get it
cracking off
Cracking off a
Smirnoff to quickly
turn to Molotov
Molotov the
spaceship doors
before that bitch is
taking off
It always seems the
poorest persons
Are people forsaken
No Washingtons
On the captain's log
They’d rather lead
us to the grayest
water poison deadly
smog
Mass un-blackening
Rather see we in a
three-by-three
structure with many
bars
Leave us where we
are so they can play
among the stars
They taking off to
Mars
What
Reputation ain’t
glowing
If you find yourself
stuck in a creek
Used to see the TV
screen as the place
to land my dream in
And the car stereo
where they would
promote the show
Optimistic little
brother with a hope
you know

Verse 2: Q-Tip
Sit and wonder
sometimes
All these
happenings is
cycular
And the president's
refined
With about thirty
Percocets and five
bottles of wine
Carolina nothing
finer than a Black
woman who climbs
To the top of the
State building
claiming that that
flag is mine
Now
Put so much in this
muthafucka
Put it on TV
These notions and
ideas and citizens
live in space
I chuckle just like all
of y'all
Takes money to get
it running and
money for trees to
fall
Imagine for one
second all the
people are colored
Imagine for one
second all the
people in poverty
No matter the skin
tone
Think the ones who
got it
Would even think to
throw you a bone?
Moved you out your
neighbourhood
Nah cypher
Imagine if this shit
was really talkin’
about space
Imagine if this shit
was really talkin’
about space
Imagine if this shit
was really talkin’
about space

Outro
The danger must be
growing
For the rowers keep
on rowing
And they’re certainly
not showing
Any signs that they
are slowing!
We’re there!
Where?
Here!
A small step for
mankind
But a giant step for
us
Oompa
I’ve got another
puzzle for you
                     16
We don't believe
you 'cause we the
people
Are still here in the
rear
You in the killing-off-
good-young-nigga
mood
When we get hungry
we eat the same
fucking food
The ramen noodle
Your simple voodoo
is so maniacal
The irony is that this
bad bitch in my lap
She don't love me
She gon' give it to
me
She gon' take the
brain to wetter
plains
The doors have
signs with
VH1 has a show that
you can waste your
time with
Guilty pleasures
take the edge off
reality
And for a salary I'd
probably do that shit
sporadically
The OG Gucci boots
are smitten with
iguanas
The IRS piranha see
a nigga gettin'
commas
Niggas in the hood
living in a fishbowl
Gentrify here
Trendsetter
Ain't settling
because I ain't so
bold but ay

Hook: Q-Tip
All you Black folks
All you Mexicans
And all you poor
folks
Muslims and gays
So all you bad folks

Bridge: Phife Dawg
& Q-Tip
The fog and the
smog of news
media that logs
False narratives of
Gods that came up
against the odds
We're not just nigga
rappers with the
bars
It's kismet that we're
cosmic with the
stars

Verse 2: Phife Dawg
You bastards
overlooking street
art
Better yet
So motherfuck your
numbers and your
statisticians
Fuck y'all know
about true
competition?
That's like a AL
pitcher on deck
talking about he
hittin'
The only one who's
hitting are the ones
that's currently
spittin'
We got your missy
smitten rubbing on
her little kitten
Dreaming of a world
that's equal for
women with no
division
Boy
Like Tony Romo
when he hitting
Witten
The Tribe be the
best in they division
Shaheed
Muhammad cut it
with precision
Who can come back
years later
Still them tryna
move we off the
fucking block
Babylon
Two pon yuh

Verse 1: Phife Dawg
Say am I 'posed to
be dead or doin' life
in prison?
Just another dummy
caught up in the
system
Unruly hooligan who
belongs in Spofford
Verse getting that
degree at Stanford
or Harvard
Threatened by my
work ethic
Should I be mentally
weak
Should I be trapped
in the trap? Would
you prefer that?
Fourth grade
reading level but he
knows how to rap
Are you amused by
our struggles? The
English that's
broken?
The weed that I'm
smokin'? The guns
that I'm totin'?
The drugs that I'm
sellin'? No need for
improvement
Fuck you and who
you think I should be

Verse 2: Jarobi
Melanated shrouded
in complexity
Brain charge
shocking like
'lectricity
Mouth translate
happens organically
The media relates it
what it thinks it sees
Judging steps in
shoes of a path they
never walked
Shot down in a
blaze of a phrases is
how they talk
Dark skinned
I'm chillin'
Subliminate their
youth
They ain't got the
strong enough hold
Pumping false
religions to all of
these niggas'
systems
Every voice devoid
of the truth
Come on


Verse 3: Q-Tip
Man look at this
Whatever will be will
be
Like a billionaire
investin' in a nigga's
dreams
Certainly a head
scratcher
Or a women with the
wisdom who's
leadin' the way
The rarity is in the
rear
Man
On the strength of
what it is
And your lady calls
you dirty
You'll find out only if
she tells you
In the answer for
cancer in a
prodigious kid's
mind
Yes
And from that lie
In the eyes of
despair and
adversity
In some universe

Hook: Q-Tip
Everybody runnin'
when they see the
storm's comin'
But whatever's
gonna be will be
Everybody runnin'
when they see the
storm's comin'
But whatever's
gonna be will be
Some will dash to
the mountain
And the weakest
amongst them
But the strongest in
faith
Everybody runnin'
when they see the
storm's comin'
But whatever's
gonna be will be


Verse 4:
Consequence
I just wanna feel as
liberated as lions in
Liberia
Cause recently my
heart turned cold as
Siberia
Cause everywhere I
go

you know all your
Tribe trivia
Green and the white
North side of
Queens
This is for my dawgs
from Shih Tzus to

With a box and a

boy movement
Live and direct when

You an idiot boy
Big tune make the

Make way for the

One box off in your

Oh yes
Afrocentric living
A lot to the cause
Some brothers
Coming off like the
days when we used
to wear the tans and
A blue-collar talker
A glass of OJ and a
ten mile walk-a
If you're in a Jeep
and you dig what
you're hearing
Can I get a beep
and a side order of
cheering?
I am what I am
We all know the
colors
As we start our
travels
Que sera sera
Won't be gone for
long
If you can't pull it

Hook
Push it along
Push it along
Push it along
Push it along
Push it along
Push it along
Push it along
Push it along


Verse 2: Phife Dawg
Put one up for the
Phifer
The ills of the world
make the situation
lighter
The clock is always
ticking
Like Tip said in
"Ham and Eggs"
Should I release the
lever
Embellish on the
funk as we start to
endeavor?
The roots of the rap
filling up the gap
With the smash of a
hand and a little toe
tap

Verse 3: Q-Tip
The boom
Indicates to the
brothers that we be
on the flip tip
Phonies start to
crumble
Through the dance-
hall
It's the nitty-gritty
So I kick the slash
for the gipper and
the witty
This ain't trial and
error
Constantly rude as
some sort of tribal
terror
The street can't
depart from the
bloody heart
Repair the wear and
tear
Won't be gone for
long
If you can't pull it

Hook
Push it along
Push it along
Push it along
Push it along
Push it along
Push it along
Push it along
Push it along


Verse 4: Q-Tip
Marching off the
project
It's good to be an
object and never
The tribe who
meanders with
drunken
propaganda
Keep it in boom and
never will we
slander
Redeems should be
handed
Money gives a
nudge to the poet
star bandit
Control it
Mysterious is the
tribe for we choose
it
Although she's
flipping crazy
God
The pigs are
wearing blue
We'll be going up
the creek in a great
big canoe
What we gonna do
Hop inside the bed
and pull over the
covers
Never will we do
that and we ain't
trying to rule that
We just want a slab
of the ham
This society of fake
reality
Are nothing but a
peg of informality
While I sing my
song
If you can't pull it

Hook
Push it along
Push it along
Push it along
Push it along
Push it along
Push it along
Push it along
Push it along

Verse 1: Q-Tip
Ten after one I think
I'll hop the horse
Downtown '83 of
course
Just came from
fishing
Downtown they'll
probably have a
batch
A whiting sandwich
and a Guinness
Stout
But with the beer
though I had a bout
So I exchanged it for
some apple juice
I had the blues but I
shook them loose
A jeep is blasting
from the urban
streets
Loops of funk over
hardcore beats
The moon dabbles
in the morning sky
As the minutes just
creep on by
I get a thought and
here comes my
Tribe
Ritual shakes and in
good vibes
Like always the
Quest begins
In the mist though
but the rhythms
moving
We find a spot and
we sit and chat
Speaking on the
status quo of rap
A derelict makes a
real long speech
We pay attention to
the words he read
When he was done
we rattled on
There was no rush
because it wasn't
dawn
We pointed things
out about these
times
The worlds famines
and the crazy
crimes
Inflation of the
nation
I better go gold
Gotta be swift 'n
society
The man whose
made is the man
who maxes
The grounds for
living are being
discussed
As we go
Gather thoughts and
savor breath
Cause there's only a
few hours left

Verse 2: Q-Tip
Me oh my
The human hours
are here to stay
This is how it seems
as Phife's my
witness
Bug out all night
Girls be screaming
on this conversation
I have my two cents
for a revelation
And my watch
continuously tick-
tocks
Shaheed will bring
up the beats that
rocks
I hear the frogs and
the smashing of
bottles
A car revs up and I
hear it throttle
It probably moves
with the morning
wind
Oh my God
Hear him talking
about last night's
game
Trying to remember
someone's name
So hear the frogs
dancing in the
streets
Once again Ali will
bring up the beat
Like this

Verse 3: Q-Tip
The beat is over and

The sun is risen and
the shine is bright
We all say peace

ways
Youth is fading as
we gain our days
Expedition for the
song is simp'
The hours creep
As we go you hear a
gasp of laugh
As we start up our
rhythmic path

After hours it was

After hours it was

As we start trudging
Me and my brothers
we be looking and
be bugging
Vehicles of life they
be rolling and be
nudging
Searching for the
virgins of life
That be shoving out
the door that's crack
The valleys of time
As least the beat will
combine
The calluses and
corns with the funky
bassline
You don't need
Underdog for a
nickel shoeshine or
the shoes that's phat
But can I get a level
on the bass and on
the treble?
Footing up and
down like a UNLV
Rebel
The answer be
amongst us 'cause
we really dig
acoustics
Can't be too much
flacking
You must container
that at least to dip
your hand in rap
Your feet will be
infectious so at least
realize the fact
The rhythms are
inserted and the
nurse can be
converted
This ain't rock 'n' roll
'cause the rap is in
control
If you're a megastar
I'd rather go
barefooting
All over the earth if
we can get there
first
Now that we are in it
So if you recognize
'em
They'll probably be
the ones with the
size nine flying
All over the field
If you want
protection you can
hide behind the
shield

Interlude: Jesse
Jackson
And the musician
often tries to capture
the new thing so

It's rough and tough
in this ghetto

Verse 2: Q-Tip
You can game on
the gallons if you
really need to rock
But we walk while
we talk as we
stomping through
the block
Hand in hand 'cross
the land as
Muhammad cross
the fade
It's a Tribe who
meanders
It's a art
The mind will
unwind
Catch the track
You will find yourself
behind for a map

See the levels
peaking as the
rhythms keep-a
screeching
A Quest
The point
The liveliness is
mean as we scoot
across the star
We are bulging
Explanation for the

Keep it wild
But dig it in the

If there's a storm

Our thing as we

Joy inside the

A chair is not a chair
Because my skin is
brown
Rub it in the face

When you get your

it'll linger
Sing a song o'

You can come while

Get emotions off

Verse 1: Q-Tip
My mother went
away for a month-
long trip
Her and some
friends on an ocean
liner ship
She made a big
mistake by leaving
me home
I had to roam so I
picked up the phone
Dialed Ali up to see
what was going
down
Told him I pick him
up so we could drive
around
Took the Dodge
Dart
My mother left a
yard but I needed
one more
Shaheed had me
covered with a
hundred greenbacks
So we left Brooklyn
and we made big
tracks
Drove down the Belt
Came to a toll
Had no destination
Ali laid in the back
so he can get rest
Drove down the
road for two-days-
and-a-half
The sun had just
risen on a dusty
path
Just then a figure
had caught my eye
A man with a
sombrero who was
4 feet high
I pulled over to ask
where we was at
His index finger he
tipped up his hat
El segundo
If you need
directions
Need a civilization
He said a mile south
there's a fast food
station
Thanks
Ali said "Damn




Skit
Well

Verse 2: Q-Tip
Anyway a gas
station we passed
We got gas and
went on to get grub
It was a nice little
pub in the middle of
nowhere
Anywhere would
have been better
I ordered enchiladas
and I ate 'em
Ali had the fruit
punch
When we finished
we thought for ways
to get back
I had a hunch
Ali said: pay for
lunch
Pulled out the wallet
and I saw this
wicked beautiful
lady
She was a waitress
there
Put the wallet down
and stared and
stared
To put me back into
reality
Yo Tip man, you got
what you need?
I checked for keys
and started to step
And what do you
know


Skit
It was a brown
wallet
It had my jimmy hats

Verse 3: Q-Tip
Lord
The heat got hotter
I feel bad but he
makes me feel
badder
Chit-chit-chatter
Breaking on out
Jetting on down at
the speed of sound
Three days coming
and three more
going
We get back and
there was no slack

Narration Common
Long before we
know ourselves
Some may never
figure out their
purpose in life and
some will
There are a lot of us
who are caught up
in this hell we all live
in
Content with being
blinded by rules and
judgment
We live in a world
where it's more okay
to follow than to lead
In this world being a
leader is trouble for
the system we are
all accustomed to
Being a leader in
this day and age is
being a threat
Not many people
stood up against the
system we all call
life
But toward the end
of our first ten years
into the millennium
we heard a voice
A voice who was
speaking to us from
the underground for
some time
A voice who spoke
of vulnerabilities and
other human
emotions and issues
never before heard
so vividly and
honest
This is the story of a
young man who not
only believed in
himself but his
dreams too
This is the story of
the Man on the
Moon
                    40
I got 99 problems
and they all bitches
Wish I was Jigga
man
But I'm not Shawn
or Martin Louis
I'm that Cleveland
nigga rollin' with
them Brooklyn boys
You knowin' how it
be when you start
living large
I control my own life
No sitcom could
teach Scott about
the dram
Or even explain the
troubles that
haunted my mom
On Christmas time
Got me most of
what I wanted
She copped the toys
I would play with in
my room by myself
Why he by himself?
He got two older
brothers; one hood
An independent
older sister kept me
fly when she could
But they all didn't
see
The little bit of
sadness in me
Scotty

Chorus
I've got some issues
that nobody can see
And all of these
emotions are
pouring out of me
I bring them to the
light for you
This is the
soundtrack to my life

Verse 2
I'm super paranoid
Since my father died
And I tried to piece
the puzzle of the
universe
Split an eighth of
shrooms just so I
could see the
universe
I try and think about
myself as a sacrifice
Just to show the
kids they ain't the
only ones who up at
night
The moon will
illuminate my room
And soon I'm
consumed by my
doom
Once upon a time
It's all said and done
and my cock's been
sucked
So now I'm in the
cut
My heart's an open
sore that I hope
heals soon
I live in a cocoon
opposite of Cancún
Where it is never
sunny
So it's more than
right
Not many people of
this planet
understand


Chorus
I've got some issues
that nobody can see
And all of these
emotions are
pouring out of me
I bring 'em to the
light for you
This is the
soundtrack to my life
Verse 3
I'm this close to go
and trying some
coke
And a happy ending
would be slittin' my
throat
Ignorance to cope
Ignorance is love
and I need that shit
If I never did shows
then I'd prolly be a
myth
If I cared about the
blogs then I'd prolly
be a jackass
Don't give a shit
what people talkin'
'bout
Haters shake my
hand but I keep the
sanitizer on deck
Hope I really get to
see 30
Wanna settle down
Most of the clean
faces be the most
dirty
I just need a
thoroughbred
Ass all chunky
Only things that
calm me down;
pussy
And I get both
I am happy

Chorus
I've got some issues
that nobody can see
And all of these
emotions are
pouring out of me
I bring 'em to the
light for you
This is the
soundtrack to my life

Verse 1
Simple as that for
your simple ass
Ask about that
I'm dreaming on
good for a sicker
plan
Sicker than any
other nigga could be
thinking
I can't be a loser
I can't be a lame
I feel I love the fame
Thinking now what I
should be twitterin'
(1-2-3)
Why'd big bro take
all the hot bitches?
Dear God
I'll be the underdog

I will live through a
song

Chorus
As simple as that
As simple as that for
your simple ass
As simple as that
As simple as that for

As simple as that

Verse 2
Uh
Simple way I wish
you would've called
it how it should've
been
They try to tell me
they don't get it
Now I'll be damned I
came this far to let a
fool live
I gotta terminate the
hate
Without it being
wack and cheesy to
the little kids
So I curse like a
sailor and I smoke
weed
I am exactly who an
older rapper's kids
be
And who they love
Probably think they
drug addicts if they
spit a Cudi verse
Mad lil' mama
switch to Converse
without a purse
Long as the booty
lookin' juicy and he
stylin' on 'em

Chorus
As simple as that
As simple as that for
your simple ass
As simple as that
As simple as that for
your simple ass
As simple as that
As simple as that for
your simple ass
(Tried in some) (1-2-

As simple as that

As simple as (1-2-3)

Narration Common
As our hero seems
to be dreaming in
peace
A dark chapter
unfolds
Throwing Scott into
the most eerie

And unstable part of
his imagination
So intense he
cannot tell his
dreams from reality
This is the Rise of
the Night Terrors
                    42
Listen good
But what I might feel
are the sounds of
sanity
Hoping what I hear
loops itself
continuously
Then I won't be
afraid

Chorus
Oh
Why must it feel so
wrong
When I try and do
right? Do right
Oh
Soaring through
paradise
When I'm closing
my eyes
I'm Mr. Solo Dolo
Oh
Oh

Verse 2
Look at me
Am I someone
whom you may love
Am I speaking for
you and yours
I need some
answers

Chorus
Oh

Oh
Soaring through

Verse 3
My world turns
To the ones who
figure
Me outcast
Back in Shaker
Heights where they
knew who
Do's little brother
was a strange one
Cry me a river
Traveled out an
igloo
Cold-cold world
wasn't fit for me at
all
Look at where I
stand at
Clutchin' my Kid
Cudi bizzalls
Mute motherfuckers
back home
Gargle on my mayo
Look at me
Floating in my mind
Ahoy

Verse 4
Listen good
This is
Hoping what I hear
loops itself to finish
me
No

Chorus
Oh

Outro
Why must it feel so

When I know that it's

When will I ever

From the words in
my songs?

Please save a kid
that needs some
help
And I can't begin to
think of anything
that could help
But the weed is
guaranteed
How I feel
When I recollect
how it used to be
Like David and
Goliath
And the Devil tryna
rip out my soul
Tryna catch a nigga
on sleep
You can try again
and I'll be ready
Won't let you kill me
in my dream like
Freddy Krueger

My mama told me

You can't regret it if
you were trying
At the end of the

I'm walking with a

Verse 2
Please save a kid
that needs some
help
And I can't see
ahead of me so I
move in stealth
Hide and seek
within a dream I
seem to glide above
my horror
Though I feel I'll
never be complete
inside the dark I
borrow
To proceed and
remain intact my
mental is so
unstable
And they talk and
judge a man
They have no clue
of what I'm capable
Til I show a side of
me no one had
thought could be
within
I told you


Chorus
At the end of the

My mama told me
don't let no one

You can't regret it if

The heart of a lion

Verse 3
I'm just a kid who
needs no help
I've achieved a
bigger thing
No cash or check
could be more
blessed
And if you had ever
seen the things I've
seen up in my
slumber
You'd be shook
No need to run
You should know
This world
understands no
coward
It's a goal
And I know the fight
in me is somewhere
hiding deep within
I told you


Chorus
At the end of the

Before I had status
and before I had a
pager
You could find the
Abstract listenin' to
hip-hop
My pops used to
say
I said
It's all expected
If you got the money
Come on everybody
Still got room on the
truckload of black
boom
Listen to the rhymes
Of this black man
Why do I say that?
'Cause I gotta speak
the truth
Doin' what we feel
for the music is the
proof
Planted on the
ground
Bona fide strong
The unit
Delivering each year
an LP filled with
street goods
You can find it on
your rack in your
record store
If you get the record
And appreciated
We work hard
Dishin' out the
plastic
If you diss—it gets
drastic
Listen to the rhyme
If it moves your
booty
All the way to Africa
Stick out the left
That's the right hand
Only if you are
noted as my man
If I get the credit
If you fake moves
Get in the zone of
positivity
Cause we gotta
strive for longevity
If you botch up
(What?) A pair of
Nikes

We gotta make

Interlude: Sample
Time, time is a ship
on a merciless sea
Drifting toward an
abyss of
nothingness
Until it can be
recharted for its own
destiny
Time is an
inanimate object
paying and paying
and paying for no
justification for belief
Time is dancing,
boogalooing-away
all memories of past

Verse 2: Q-Tip
We gotta be a
winner all the time
Can't fall prey to a
hip-hop crime
With the dope raps
and dope tracks we
move blocks
From the fly girlies
to the hardest of the
rocks
Musically the Quest
We on these
excursions so you
must realize
That continually
If you don't like it
So what can you do
in the times which
exist
You can't fake
moves on your
brother or your sis
But if your sis is a
bitch
Leave 'em both
alone and continue
with your work
Whatever it may be
in today's society
Everything is fair
You must be honest
and true to the next
Don't be phony and
expect one not to
flex
Especially if you
rhyme
Your man is your
man
All it is
So listen to the
knowledge being
dropped over beats
Beats that are hard
They could get you
hooked like a
crackhead junkie
What you gotta do is
know the Tribe is in
the sphere

The five foot

roughneck business
I float like gravity
Got more rhymes
than the Winans got
family
No need to sweat
Arsenio to gain
some type of fame
No shame in my
game cause I'll
always be the same
Styles upon styles
upon styles is what I
have
You wanna diss the
Phifer but you still
don't know the half
I sport New Balance
sneakers to avoid a
narrow path
Mess around with
this you catch a size
eight up your ass
I never half step
cause I'm not a half

Drink a lot of soda
so they call me Dr.
Pepper
Refuse to compete
with BS competition
Your name ain't

So won't you seckle
with the mission
I never walk the
street thinking it's all

Even though deep in

I just try my best to

Some might even
say yo shorty black
you're buggin' out

Right on the two

Not the best not the

occasionally I curse
To get my point

As I go in between
Listen to the mission
listen Miss as I do

As I crack the
Children of the jazz
so
Smokin R&B cause
they try to do me
Or the best of the

do rap
For it's Abstract
You can't get your

Verse 3: Phife Dawg
Yo when you bug
out
You usually have a
reason for the action
Sometimes you do it
just for mere
satisfaction
People be hounding
Pulsing
You don't really fret
Camouflage your
feeling
You soar off to
another world
But people seem to
take that
Oh yo he's acting
stank, really on a
regal?
A man of the fame
not a man of the
people
Believe that if you
wanna but I tell you
this much
Riding on the train
with no dough
Once again a case
of your feet in my
Nike's
If a crowd is in my

Hip-hop is living

Verse 4: Q-Tip
Yo
I used to smoke the
weed out
Ali Shaheed
Muhammad used to
say I had to be out
Scheming on the
cookies with the
crazy booming back
buns
Pushing on them
real hard just so we
can have the big fun
When I left for road
Battling a MC was
when Tip was at his
maddest
It was one MC after
one MC
What the world
could they be
wanting see from
little old me
Do I have the
formula to save the
world?
Or was it just
because I used to
Swipe the women
and all the girls
I'm the type of
brother with the
crazy extended
hand
Dissed by all my
brothers I was all up
what my man did
Supposed to be my
man
But now I wonder
cause you're feeble
I go out with the
strongies and I
separate the evils
It's your brain
against my mind
All you nasty critters
even though you
see I bug out

Verse 1: Q-Tip
To the effect of
nothing
Is what I don't allow
so let me tell you
something
I am a bonafide
Not too modest and
not a lot of pride
Soon to have a ride
and a home to
reside
If my mama is sick
I'm by her bedside
Used to watch the
show on Channel 4
called Riptide
Wash my wears in
Tide cause it's too
damn cold out-tide
That's how the
runnings go
If there ain't no
dough then there
ain't no show
So take your roly
poly fat promoter
(ass)
To the Chemical
Bank
If you wanna see the
people scream and
laugh
You best Quest
Cause I don't wanna
see 'em
Throwing chairs in
the air while you be
ducking
What what? Don't
step to me with that
If you promoting a
show make sure it
ain't wack
Or else I'm leaving
("Let me tell you")
I'm leaving ("Let me
tell you")
I'm leaving ("Let me
tell you")
Your wack show

I want chicken and
orange juice
And my occasional
potato by Ore-Ida
Don't forget my
pastry make sure
they're tasty
I'm not the type to
be pushy or hasty
See I'm the type of
bro that's reared in

Took a few shorts
before
Now the only ones I
take are the ones
that I wear
Ain't taking no

Please act proper

Don't dip on the

Make sure you

real slow
Be alert

Not
So what? You got a

I got one too
Don't break fool
We don't have to act

And we'll do a fly

Verse 1: Phife Dawg
1988 senior year at
Garvey High
Where all the guys
were corny but the
girls were mad fly
Lounging with the
Tipster
Scoping out the
honeys—they know
who they are
I was the b-ball
playing
Fly girl getting but
never was I
sweating
Cause when it came
to honeys I would go
on a stroll
Until I met my match
—her name was Flo
Yeah
All the troopers
'round the way used
to call her a ho
But deep down in
my heart I knew that
Flo was good to go
Cause I thought it
was me like Bell Biv
Devoe
But little did I know
that she was playing
with my mind
The only thing I
learned is good girls
are hard to find
I feel like Heavy D
Not someone whose
mind is blank and
tryna juice me for
my banks
Swinging with my
main man Lucky
behind my back
What type of crap is
that—yo
Word life
But now it seems
I was a stone cold
lover
Settling down with
one girl
I had Tonya
Tina
Used to love 'em
Find 'em
My whole attitude
was new day
And believe it or not
Well here comes Flo
with the crazy whip
appeal
And I'm all true man
like Alexander
O'Neal
Is this really love
After all this time
trying to be a super
ho
She finally played
me
Cause I got the
crazy game and yo

Chorus: Q-Tip
Ayo
It's like butter
It's like butter
It's like butter
It's like butter
It's like butter

Verse 2: Phife Dawg
I remember when
girls were goodie
two shoes but now
they turning freaks
All of a sudden (we
love you Phife!)
ease off ho
Phife this
These girls don't
know me from jack
You didn't want me
then
Here
And take the contact
out your eye
You get an E for
effort
Now tell me what's
the reason
Slum village gold
still dangling in your
ear
You barely have a
neck but still
sporting a rope
Four-finger ring just
so Phifer can scope
You looked in the
mirror
Yesterday your eyes
were brown but
today they are blue
Your whole
appearance is a lie
and it could never
be true
And if you really
liked yourself then
you would try and
be you
If your hair and eyes
were real
But since it was
bought
But if you can't
achieve it
If you can't extend it
then you might as
well suspend it
If you can't braid it
I asked who did your
hair and you tell me
If you were you and
just you
But I can't stand
Trying hard to look
fly
If I wanted someone
like you I would've
swung with Jaime
Sommers
You wanna be
treated right
Or check Ralph
Tresvant
Cause I am not the
one
Phife Dawg is on the
mic and I'm smooth
like butter

my man last night
And my man came
by the studio
And his name is...

Verse 1: Q-Tip
I'm moving
Use the Coast in the
morning to avoid the
funky odor
Can't help being
funky
Funky in a sense
Once had a fetish
Now I'm getting
funky in my rap and
that's my duty
Brothers tend to
jock on the style in
particular
If you got the ego
like some brothers
then I'll get with ya
But if I don't pursue
My motto in the 90's
is be happy making
bucks
Girls love the jim
When it goes up in
and fluctuates the
diction
I still understand the
oomph cause that's
what I met her for
I'm hooked on the
swing
Women love the
voice
Quest the people's
choice
If you can't hear it
Write my rhymes
straight up
The rhymes be
getting sweet
A perfectionist at
work
If you want to battle
Your demise is
coming up and I
want your man to
watch
Be the prime
example
Insignificance
Born up in Harlem
The girl I used to
rock
Now what does that
make her? The evil
money taker?
The crazy move
faker

Verse 2: Q-Tip
I must regroup my
thoughts and kick
the next ones for my
people
Please don't be
deceived by the ugly
slice of evil
The world is kinda
cold and the rhythm
is my blanket
Wrap yourself up in
it
Don't move to
rebuttal
Some women in the
90's want more than
satisfaction
They want keys and
Gs
If you want to
I keep a tight net
with my brothers
Ken and Kenny
If the question is of
rhymes
The thing that men
and women need to
do is stick together
Progressions can't
be made if we're
separate forever

beat with the loop

know the mental
People tend to bug
cause the beats are
hard but gentle
Africano lurks
through the body of
this youngun'
Play like Bobby
Byrd on your back
and you're coming
to
The house of the
jazz
All the goods are
welcome
I'll just wait and
debate
If flexing is your
motive
The Abstract is
speaking
To Black and Puerto
Ricans cause
they're butt naked
streaking
Through the ever
murky streets of the
urbanized areas
Blasting out the
speakers is the hip
hop hysteria

Chorus: Q-Tip &
Vinia Mojica
Craig is in the house
(ooohh
Pete Rock is in the
house (this ain't a
R&B song)
CL is in the house
(you got it going on)
Ultramag is in the
house (and on and
on and on)
Nice and Smooth is
in the house
Big Daddy Kane is
in the house
Beatnuts is in the
house
Special Ed is in the
house

Outro: Q-Tip
Yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah
yeah
And this one goes
out to my man
Thanks a lot Ron
Carter on the bass
Yes my man Ron
Carter is on the
bass
And check it out
Up in until the 2000
decade
You gotta say the
Quest is on
And goddamn it
And we out!
                    40
To know the truth is
to know the self
To know the self is
to know the Mecca
Mecca's not a state
of mind or a place
Mecca is a way of
life
It is the answer to all
confusion
The attribute
Adofo Abdullah
Muhammad
Makes way for the
return of the Mecca
Salaam

Hook x8
Return of the Mecca

Verse 1: C.L.
Smooth
Be sure to explore
the hardcore that
came before
Columbus
Discover no other
serve the soul on a
dish
Okay means official
kid
The lyrical dynamo
set the flow when I
do so
Entice the price with
the mic device
Hit ya slice so
precise that you
never hurt twice
Fierce how I pierce
when you near the
frontier
A world premiere so
put the armor on
your gear
The overlord aboard
with the two-edged
sword
Adored and restored
Preserve the herb
Vocalize a verb
Mecca
From the whole
agenda
A richer voice than
Robin Leach
I'll reach with a
speech
Monumentally
smooth
To barely when
you're near me
clearly never sound
weary
Maintain the gravity
So sweet the repeat
you're bound to
catch a cavity
My ability to wreck a
facility
C.L.'s potential
Deep in every
measure
The midnight
wrecker


Hook

Verse 2: C.L.
Smooth
Overstand the
Mecca in command
Part of the plan is
the man who built
the land he began
A scripture ripped
out the piece of a
scroll
Better the know yes
Start em in Harlem
with the motto
Boogie to me
Stable like a
turntable
No fable
You're coming to me
so therefore the
program's Mecca
The silhouette
Talking about the
theoretical
Alphabetical rebel
Unveil a tale in
detail
Read it in braille
Now I sink into the
link
You's too large to
shrink
And toast to
emperor
To know of a child
And never to be
lobotomized
But you know the
answer when I drop
a proper grammar
Tabasco
I manage to do
damage so honey
Risen from the
prison
Strictly for your
pleasure


Hook

Break

Verse 3: C.L.
Smooth
OD off the black
Baryshnikov
Taking it up north
Bound to see me
swollen like a
Beethoven
Listen wide open
Save the sarcasm
Back off of that and
maybe later let you
pat em
Necessary for any
adversary to worry
The legendary
Dip in Peru
Now if you knew the
preview
Outclass the mass
so we'll look in the
hourglass
No time to waste for
those in contrast
Like the New York
Philharmonic
With the logic I hear
like a narcotic
Put your best to rest
I got the wild
You know the cause
of death
Another got sloppy
so I lit it in poppy
Smooth as Peabo
For the grand finale I
slip on like a Bally
C.L. and P.R.
The soul brother
The classic fantastic
Here to get drastic
                     41
I collect the loot and
then I knock the
boots
A smooth dark
brother
Cause I can do
wonders undercover
I'm dip-dip-dope
I cleanse like soap
Stay away from the
penile
Hons always wave
cause slick like Nu-
nile
Pete Rock on the
boot knock
Plus the way that I
flow...blood clot

Mm-hmm
So funky
Like I said before

For Pete's sake I
break and update
A dubplate to
navigate the tune I
make
I fit like a slipper
Vital signs are
quicker
Showtime original
I hit the cliches on
the subliminal
With the soul
technician to fill the
prescription
In addition listen
close to the mission
The
P.E.T.E.R.O.C.K.
With the route to
Brut by Faberge
No doubt
Offspring of lyrics
when the
microphone's
pregnant
Give it a rubdown
Everywhere you go
you hear Mecca
from the Vernon
Pound for pound
And bound to spin
the record like a
merry-go-round
The klepto flow that
I touch is not a
preemie
And who would ever
see me when I
dream of Jeanie
I don't think so
And shake like an
earthquake


To my man...

Here come's the
rugged one
I collect the loot and
then I knock the
boots
A smooth dark
brother
Cause I can do
wonders undercover
I'm dip-dip-dope
I cleanse like soap
Stay away from the
penile
Hons always wave
cause I'm slick like
Nu-nile
Pete Rock on the
boot knock
Bust the way that I
flow...blood clot
Yo
Niggas know the
time
I'm not the type to
fake it
Tie your girl to the
back of my Jeep
butt-naked
Slide her monkey
ass down the hill
So if you don't want
beef
To my man...

Music please...

(C.L.) The Mecca's
sweet like nectar
There's a ribbon in
the sky
In the days of
thunder
Here steps the one
Survey says the
black pres can make
you wiggle
The staff to the craft
Perfect stranger
Loopholes are filled
when I build with the
skill
Liquid steels the mic
on the Rock's chill
No financial aid
wade when I'm paid
Deep as the
Everglade
Study in the
archives
Head crack back to
back for the bail
money
For you
Lickin' on your
daughter
Now
Draw warm like a
spa
C.L. Smooth and
Pete Rock
Could break and
penetrate


To my man...

For Pete's Sake


To my godson little
CL rock the house
And Dafo rock the

And To my brother
Grap Luva rock the

And B.I. rock the

To the YGs rock the

To my man Black

I catch a body at a
party
Look above and see
the vultures fly
around in a circle
Baggin' while you're
lollygaggin'
Assassin with the
millimeter roars of a
dragon
Here stood the black
hood
And for the love of
money
Public housing
So I'm forced to sell
hell just to pay the
rent
Killin' my own
people
Just like the liquor
store scene on
every corner
I'm tryin' but the kids
keep cryin'
Look
Finally the cops
come dumb to the
slum
Pull out a gun and
arrest the wrong one
Wax all the Puerto
Ricans and blacks
So they can never
relax
I dwell
Pete Rock and C.L.
can radio a shack up
Sparkin' off and
have 'em all callin'
for backup
Watch another
crime and you're
gonna do time
All this you'll find in
the ghettos of the
mind

Ain't that somethin'?

Listen to cats and
rough rats war under
the window
When the ghetto
forts flurry
Livin' ain't cheap
In this part of town
where the city never
sleep
A Barney Miller
roller
Or static with your
BM
Speakin' on your
baby's mom
Always tryin' to
make a movie
Stressin' it
A place that when I
die it would never
even miss me
Crack phials in the
aisles as one pimp
smiles
Dope piles workin'
hookers by the miles
But still my pop's got
three jobs to stable
A family household
and food on the
table
So as we pray for all
our souls to keep
Somebody's on the
project roof
I want to stop the
pain or the bad
situation
But backwards
wisdom I can't afford
to give 'em
Self savior is much
braver with the
conscious behavior
Designed in the
ghettos of the mind

Ain't that somethin'?
Yeah
It's like that y'all


I could never look
forward to an early
retirement
But still I maintain in
a hostile
environment
Hustlin' the concrete
jungle for loot
My parents hated
blood money so
they gave me the
boot
Take a risk cause
the peer pressure
has the edge
It was a blessin'
when I saw my life
dangle on the ledge
The streets coulda
swallowed me whole
But the pain was all
gone when I got to
see my healthy son
born
And now I bring him
home to the ghetto
Only to make a
stronger fellow
Maybe do some
good for the
neighborhood
It's hard playing
hero livin' less than
a zero
Raging Bull like
DeNiro
A concentration
camp with the
Section 8
Welfare checks
given at a monthly
rate
Apply for the get
high
Many steady collect
right around the fifth
baby
The hawk is out but
the niggas never
pack it
A hundred dollar
sneakers with the
skimpy-ass jacket
When people are
deaf
Imagine in the
ghettos of the mind

Here comes the
hurricane
Cut by the grain
when I land upon
the plain
Jah knew the
Hebrew
But none of the fam
who saw had a clue
Escalate the prime
rate
Generate the mind's
state
Nigga
Funny like a cartoon
Pimp are the lyrical
But the
metaphysical isn't
spriritual
Straight from the
heart I frame the art
Tutor up my class
Dictate the
technique
Loved by my son
and a kiss on the
cheek
Stutter-step the
concept
Steady as we go so
act like you know

Verse 2
I stand by the rabbi
Always had an alibi
even if I lie
Crucial
Past time
Light skin in lovely
gyp
Here to make a
megahit fit
Don't install the pipe
dream
When you run
ragged I pick up the
steam
Chart on the record
book
Here's a new book
to civilize a crook
Purest of the
pedigree
C.L.
Thick like a dred
The Mecca Don
said
Pete Rock
Swing low and yell
"Geronimo!"

Verse 3
C.L. can play like
Nike
Pacify the Gemini
Pete to my beat is a
rock like concrete
Hard for the street
A clean editorial
Affordable
Mecca is the
syndrome
Boogie on a
baritone
Libra
C.L. the girl pleaser
So here is the good
sign
Titties with the
bitties when I wine
and dine
Warm like corduroy
But just like Anita
Agoobilonians with
your knowledge
And take as said so
                    90
The DJ's name is
Premier
The DJ's name is
Premier

Yeah!
Will you please!
Will you please

Step up

Verse 1: Guru
Once you step in the
arena
Mazed when you
gaze at the armor
on this leader
Fully clad and glad
to fight a cause
Fear is a joke
That'll rip 'cause
your gift is merely
flesh
Superficial and I
wish you would give
it a rest
But if you don't
Like a noble knight
A true hero
Gettin' beat to a pulp
so that you can't run
for help
I heard a gulp in
your throat 'cause
you hope that I'll be
merciful
But coo-cluck
Battle drills
Yellow fluid
Face defeat to this
beat
As I'm pullin' out my
lance to kill you and
advance to
The winner's throne;
'cause I own you
once you step in the
arena


Scratches: DJ
Premier
Step up

Verse 2: Guru
In the arena... or
rather coliseum
There's people
gatherin' by
multitudes to see
one
Perpretrator fall to
the dust after the
other
Quickly disposed of
at the hand of a
known brother
Born with the art in
his heart that is
Spartacus
And one-to-one
combat Jack
Match-up makes
Gang Starr wanna
snatch up
One or two phrases
from the new book
with new pages
Of rhymes that are
built like a chariot
Dope vocals carry it
to the battle set
If a beat was a
princess
But now I must bow
to the crowd as I
stand proud
Victorius
Cause battles and
wars and much
fights I have been
through
One MC got
beheaded
Forget it
An onlooker
Or struck by a blow
from a mic gladiator
I betcha that later
you might be sad
that you played
yourself
Cause you stepped
up
And in just one lyric
Cause rhymin' is
serious
You'll get hurt with
these lines
And suckers can jet
'cause I wreck once
you step in the
arena

Scratches: DJ
Premier
Step inside my
arena

Verse 3: Guru
In the arena or
forum
Causin' mayhem
Furthermore I
implore that as a
soldier of war
I go in only to win
and be the holder of
more
Trophies
Never choosin' to
lose my spot
For the mere idea of
an opponent that I'd
fear
Is foolish utterly
Tryin' to toy with a
destroyer of many
You shitted your
pants 'cause you
can't think of any
Foe that could step
to this concept so
You better sit again
Watch the way they
get distraught when
they get caught
In the worst
positions 'cause
they didn't listen
And tried goin' up
against a hungry
killer who's itchin'
To maim and
murder
Toughest ones

Verse 1: Guru
Tell me
Can you groove to
this smooth tune?
You must presume
It's important for you
to follow this
creation
And hey son
So run and get
some help with the
problems that you
face
Take a taste of the
bass
Get real deep
Revolve and solve
Like a supervisor
Cause they need
someone to advise
them to discover
Things that they
don't know so the
papers I will check
Then they'll start to
grow to this form of
intellect

Hook: Cuts
Individual with
intellect

Verse 2: Guru
When the road is
too steep
First album took us
two weeks
An exclusive
attraction conducive
to your satisfaction
Those of you lackin'
So you can think
and get a grip of
Yourself by yourself
A gift that's
equipped with the
script that shocks
You can take a walk
on God
With your mouth
wide open
Way to display
similar actions in a
kind of mockery
Cause you don't
realize the cost to
be
Creative genius
please
Glance per chance
And dance your
pants like champs


Hook: Cuts
Man with intellect

Verse 3: Guru
Valuable solutions
we invent here
Break and remake
the cupcakes to
show we've been
sent here
To serve you so
swallow this and bite
it
And why bring
ignorance when
we're inviting
You to get
advancement
And don't you know
the transcript will
make you shake
hips
Or chill at will
Better get the
subject or be last at
the predicate
And get a set of
headphones and
speakers
As lyrical lessons
manifest I will keep
you
Abreast of the best
in this rap mess
Oversaturated
market full of
wackness
I'm gifted
The Guru
Don't choke
Premier's severe
Spontaneous cuts
It's the scratching
format
Craftily
Nastily
Original so get it yo
the Gang gets
respect
The chain and the
star is a symbol

I knew this chump
see... he tried to
play me
He was my right
hand man
I let him chill at my
crib
I went to work
everyday while he
was loungin'
He tried to backstab
He didn't know he
could've got his
back broken
I had to cut
homeboy off for
even tryin' that
His game was mad
weak
Stepped to him
quietly
Told him to fix it or
I'd have to catch a
body
In this society
Don't be too eager
when you're seeking
a break
Cause chumps will
exploit
So just be keen and
learn all the ins of it
I've had my share of
dealing with fake
men
I left them squealing
Proceeding exactly
I foiled the scheme
'cause it seemed I
was that man
And if you step up
like the kid who did
front
You will bear
witness the
execution of a
chump

Verse 2
Now
I'm snatchin' hearts
out of chumps
Observin acts of a
snake
Eliminate the
nucleus
Pissed
My conscience says
it's nonsense
It meaning sleazy
I'll drive 'em all to
danger
Cause if you step up
like the kid who did
front
You will bear
witness the
execution of a
chump



Verse 3
Call me the Guru
I'll reach you deftly
Elect me as your
prophet and we'll
praise him as I drop
it
Pursue this
I knowledge more
than buddhist
monks
I'll wreck the set and
grab a big chunk
Known to be a wise
one
Following my calling
in life
Minds in line to find
devine designs of
rhyme
Rewind this on your
box one time
But if you step up
like the kid who did
front
Then you will bear
witness the
execution of a
chump
                     94
Knowledge is power
You should know
the truth and the
truth shall set you
free

Verse 1
I was raised like a
Muslim
Nature of my life
relates rhymes I
release like a
cannon
Cause I been
plannin' to be
rammin' what I
wrote
Straight on a plate
down your throat
So digest as I
suggest
At who's who while
I'm readin' from my
good book
And let's dig into
every nook and
every cranny
Set your mind free
as I slam these
thoughts
And just like a
jammy goes bow
You're gonna see
what I'm sayin' now
You can't be sleepin'
You better stop
being lazy
There's many
people frontin'
All because of dumb
things
I've been through so
much that I'm such
A maniac
That we can get the
shit together so I
break
On fools with no
rhymes skills
messin' up the flow
And people with no
sense who be
movin' much too
slow
And so
Guru with the mic
and Premier raise
the anchor
Swiftly
I had to get an
attorney
I needed someone
to defend my
position
Decisions I made
And ladies
Maybe a Lexus or a
Jaguar
Still
So won't you dig the
scenario
And just imagine if
each one is teachin'
one
We'll come together
so that we become
A strong force
Find your direction
through
introspection
And for my people
out there I got a
question
Can we be the sole
controllers of our
fate?
Now who's gonna
take the weight?




Hook: Cuts by DJ
Premier
You can't handle the
whole weight

Verse 2
The weight of the
world is heavy on
my mind
So as my feelings
unwind I find
That some try to be
down just 'cause it's
trendy
Others fall victim to
envy
But I'll take the road
less traveled
So I can see all my
hopes and my
dreams unravel
Relievin' your stress
In the situation that
you're facin'
That's why I'm down
with the Nation
Spirituality supports
reality
We gotta fight with
the right mentality
So we can gain what
is rightfully ours
This is the meaning
of the chain and the
star
Land is power
Let's see how far I
can take ya
Original invincible
I use my rhymes like
a Glock automatic
Any means
necessary
Before the rains
bring the nuclear
fallout
So let me ask you
Ayo


Hook: Cuts by DJ

Now here is all
these peoples (right)
Who are moved
here...thirty
And whatever they
were moved here
by is no longer there
I see- 'cause now I
look on the street

You could drop out

you could always
get you ? that Ford

You know
And then you- you
didn't have to stand
on the corner (right)
Cause

And that was white

Nowadays

Step out the box for

On your left forearm
Like you up to no

Look you in your eye

Still got a phone in

Give me a call if
anything was
available
Didn't get the job
End of the month
First of the month
Checks
Standin' on the curb
just sellin' cocaine
With some very
close friends that'll
catch you long-

And dig in your

I still got the work

Got pills for dessert
Who flick
And then insert it in

Verse 1
I just lost my two

Would've been my
firstborn kids
It's been a series of
unfortunate events
And I'm gettin' real
leery of whom I call
my friends
Them didn't help
when I need a
helping hand
Only one that sent
me mail when I was
locked up was
Danielle
Elizabeth
Merriweather in my
jail cell
Them letters held a
nigga down like an
anvil
In that time capsule
where time stands
still
Like you runnin' laps
for practice on the
treadmill
Better beware of
what comes with all
that transactin'
Just take care of my
moms if somethin'
bad happens
Tell Arielle Marie
Jones to tell my dad
that I
Want to let it be
known that I ain't
mad at him
Taught me to stand
on my own two
With bad habits
Curse of me
He taught me how
to laugh in the face
of adversity
And how to be a
man
Now I truly
understand what
"patience is a virtue"
means

It never fails
Dead or in jail

Tires go bald
Til it putt-putt

Somebody gotta die
Hearin' rumors they
gon' take out and
murder James
You get respect
when you lay down
your murder game
I laid my game down
flat as a vertebrae
You gave your man
to the feds over
thirty days?
? turns to eternity
They say they down
Then turn around in
my state of
emergency (snakes)
They turn me down
In their time of dire
need with the
urgency
But they ain't
nowhere to be found
and it's irkin' me

hypocrites and nit-
wits
With tidbit skits
It was a curse
Gets the airplay
Of Malik
Because I have the
habit to smoke
rabbits like a addict
So if you can not rap
If you wants to pick
up on your nose
B shows the chrome
and then we cap

Verse 1: Malik B.
It's the 'I Remain
Calm'
Come out my
humble
And make you
swallow your smirk
I splurge most and
bash
I fascinate as I
assassinate and
show task
Characters and
egos get crushed in
trust
And my words
stampede like herds
in the dusk
Cream of all crops
When heated up
You never knew the
levitude the clever
few
Different tax for
revenue
The tac-tic
The rhythm
Made a nigga's
dream but his hope
deferred and stirred
Dig the mentals
My credentials flow
on instrumentals
I write an anthem
Mysterious vibes
like I was The
Phantom
Erupt abruptly
You're fucked when
the lyrics get buck
because I graze
Never animosity
Niggas acropoly
Wreak and leak out
the verbals
The chief of edit


Hook x4
I remain calm

Verse 2: Black
Thought
That nigga Thought
flows like a river
Eyes closed
Listen
The other half want
my autograph

Because I got soul
It's the mic rapers
My a capella verse
can stomp
My rated-X larynx
wrecks your context
I'm complex
I drink brews then
when I'm groovin'
I'd like to take this
time to give a shout
to all the money
makers
In the house galore
I whip the cap to the
back
I make niggas
embarrassed like
they spendin' food
stamps
I take my time when
I rhyme lovely
Like
Rappers thinkin' of
steppin' up
I amplify the hymn
to bring your empire
to ruin
Who's your girl
screwin'
Keep my sneakers
dry when you cry-
baby
See
Aiyyo
Sayin'
In the dark with the
rap devil Black
Thought
See
Into air
I resound and
astound and scare
I reign terror into
another nigga rap
era
My rhymes sedate
I'm extreme
Peace to Bed

Green fatigues

Drive is masonic
Onslaught is conic

Lime away from dry

All fall

I say tomato
Let's call the whole
thing on
Is it a joint
Quite frankly I'm still
beneath the table
Doom drank me
under
What God has
joined together
Let no man put
asunder
Escape
Bloops
And I wonder who's
loving you

Death comes in
threes like John
Paxson

What's right is right
You understand

It's alright
No
And two minutes
later he's acting like
a jerk
No
You got a little outta
order yourself
No
You insulted him a
little bit
No
Give us a drink
Okay
Come on let's have
some drinks
Drinks on the house
Come on. Let me

You don't have to

Verse
The toughest
musician in Hip-Hop
history
He's finally
mastered the art of
the MPC
Not Primo's drums
I go by Dwight
Farrell as well as
other names
The creator has a
master plan
I know it's got a lot
to do with my art
I mix it up like like a
Cuisinart
Section a new
sound
For the Vision 1.4
and S3000
I'm wide awake at 7
like Matsen (On and
on and)
But the MP haunts
me nocturnally
So now I'm tappin'
out beats 24/7
These drum
machines is like
cliffnotes
On ebonies and
ivories to make
melodies with
But these drum
pads come the
banks of sixteen
So I flip these with
the music theory
that God educates
me with

Verse 2: The
Koreatown Oddity &
C.S. Armstrong
Yeah
Moving forward
through the corridor
of becoming
detached
Even in an
avalanche of some
fabricated trash
The undisputed truth
always gets the last
laugh
That's why you see
spirits that resemble
shattered glass
That's why the
future of the world
cannot be left in
fragile hands
That's why when
you gifted
Or act like you
better than anybody
on God's green land
To be specific
I'll wait
Ain't no human
being existed that
ever skipped it
So next time they
wanna pick up their
shit and sniff it
I hope they won't be
surprised that it
don't smell terrific
Teriffic
Change of the guard
And each time it
does I'm in one

Tell us what they

cleaned up
I know you haven't
been able to rest
comfortably since
the accident
Believe you me
And you didn't have
to go to the hospital
so frequently
From a vessel in
your nose that is so
damaged
Sporadically it leaks
on you
Squeeze your nose
closed
And tilt your head
back slightly
Take a chill for a lil
bit
Some things in life
occur to build
strength
And I know that
you're just a little kid

plans for you if you
still here

Wondering
I look around
Darkness
They keep falling
down into the same
pattern
They have ideas
When they grow old
they think:
Well, now is the time
to do something
constructive
They then get on the
merry-go-round
called the circle of
life
If only they would
have held onto their
ideas
I look around
They seek the light
with false pretenses
                     44
America got a thing
for this gangster shit
So if different shit is
wack to you
I can only be honest
in the shit that I write
Take a trip through
my life
Visit the vivid
imagery I'm giving
you twice
One with the beat
You can't help but
say this nigga is
nice
But if I don't make a
tech spit
Or cop the record
If I like that shine on
your necklace
I'ma bust shots
Drop-top sped off
'fore them hot shots
let off
Now your ass can't
wear shine cause
you're neckless
(haha)
Shit
Real shit really isn't
real to you people
This is my life
This is my genre

Hook
No real family
No real escape
So I'm gon' die with
my music
By my side
No good liquor
No good pussy
So (music is the
only love)


Verse 2
You ever had a
fuckin' conversation
with a song you
sampled?
Smoking as much
weed as the bong
could handle
I was high looking
for some inspiration
A way that I could
talk through the beat
itself
Then I put on some
Graham Central
Station
Track 9 on the
album
(Music is the only
love)
Hell mothafuckin'
yeah
I'm never lonely
cause it just only
trust
That if it needs me
Can't say the same
about these phony
fucks
When I was laying in
the hospital bed
No one even cared
if I'm dead
Music was right
there
So I love music
twice as much

Verse 3
Sleepin' on the 2

18 years old
No desire to live
Dead tired
E and dope
Leave this hopeless
state of mind
Forgive me God for
saying
He forgave me
The best thing thats
ever happened to
me
That's the treble and
the bass clef
Turns out that I had
it since a baby
Because of pain
This whole world
makes me crazy
But not music
I don't make music
So

Outro
Can y'all hear me
out there? How y'all
feelin?
What's real for you?
What comes from
your heart?
My music comes
from my heart
So this is dedicated
to anyone who puts
music first
If you would rather
sing than breathe
If all you had left in
your body
Was the ability to
play your instrument
If so
If you would write a
song with your own
blood as ink

This is for you
Music is not just an
expression
It is a tourniquet to
the bleeding heart
Music is the
helicopter that saves
your soul
From the hurricane
of life
If music is all you
got
(Music is the only
love)

was so appealing
So high that I'm
touch the ceiling
Looking down at her
with the attitude of
Imus
You nappy headed

I'm just mad at the
fact you tryin to blind

I'm doin the music
that you should be

think different

I once was the loser
Now I'm older still
the same loser
That's why I look so

Everybody know my

Ain't no more things
around me change
You know who's
gone stay the same
Verse 2
It's all about the
Benjamins baby
But I been having
different sentiments
lately
Do you think these
niggas listen when
they play me?
Have you heard the
bullshit these niggas
making?
What's even more
bullshit these niggas
caking
They think so limited
they be givin it 80%
of them maybe
But take a nerd that
only listen to Shady
Jadakiss and them
with a little AZ
James Todd Smith
Incubus
And along with a
couple pounds of
that he-mi
Maybe you can
considerably be me
But I think I made it
sound too damn

you think you doin
but it ain't rapping
You hiding behind
the mic like

Yo Kirk pass me the

So I can get deep up

I'm a beast in
booths
A nice dream of ice
creams the Nike

Rakim rockin light
pink
I'll leave Harlem

to give em light feet
No A.G. involved
Me and my MGM

Niggas wanna beat
us up
Married to the game
Life's a bitch
Quick to wife her
Before the bitch try
to eat up Charles
I throw her a fuckin

You see I got my

Verse 1 Charles
Hamilton
Met her at a rave
Lost in a trance from
the Telepopmusik
I was so gone
I know I'm
intoxicated but I
don't care
Lights keep flashing
She's trying to figure
out why I keep
glancing
This is my chance
Eye contact
Two new worlds
I send my radiation
Teleport her over
my way that instant
Grabbed her
If your too high and
you can't listen
Tune in to the new
transmission
Step out of life and
make the transition
Step out of life and
make the transition

Chorus Charles
Hamilton
She's so high
Look into her eyes
She lives inside the
clouds
She screams
without a sound
She's high
Verse 2 Charles
Hamilton
Left from the rave
Off to the hard drive
I was so high
Plus I kept
envisioning the
woman I was taking
(home)
Get her naked
(clothes)
Ain't no way we
gotta (go)
Land on a lilypad
then we (coast)
Pour some digital
champagne then
(toast)
The bubbles from
the champagne
make us (float)
Aquatic clouds now
we (both) need a
(boat)
She's the high I
need the most
More than a woman
Stuck in between
This feels like a
movie scene
She's holographic
without the screen

She's so high
She's so high
She's so high
She's so high

Verse 1
I’m not too sure but I
think I’m starting to
lose it
Reality is moving
too fast for me to do
shit about it
Patience is actually
a nuisance
I’m picking up too
much slack for me
to move quick
So many areas
asking me to do shit
All I fucking hear is
“do that for me then
do this”
Sometimes I swear
I’d rather be
reclusive
I put up with so
much crap because
of music
These days killing
me
For Pete's sake
please wait
I sample my beats
but niggas can’t hold
a candle to me
And I’m Lyrically
Gifted
Put two and two
together
Inside a chapel
But the better the
music than the
closer the psychosis

Hook
It’s the voices
All I hear in my head
are these voices
Can’t run can’t hide
Some deem in my

I can’t avoid it

Some deem in my
mind it’s the voices
Can’t run can’t hide
from the voices
All I hear in my head
are these voices
I think I’m losing my
mind


Verse 2
My short temper is
shortened when I’m
faced with shit that
isn’t important
I want to see the
end of this horseshit
Bunch of niggas are
critics
Hit me with the okie-
doke
I guess being
different means
you’re being the
same
Compare me to Em
The next best is
Kanye
I guess yes
Label to un-labeled
Make them feel
unable to break
away from that one
place they take you
when they don’t
know what to make
of you
I been chasing this
dream since 13
Got a slew of ideas
like a musical genius
But I still gotta come
up with my name for
my first single

Hook
It’s the voices
All I hear in my head
are these voices
Can’t run can’t hide
Some deem in my
mind it’s the voices
I can’t avoid it
It’s the voices
Some deem in my
mind it’s the voices
Can’t run can’t hide
from the voices
All I hear in my head
are these voices
I think I’m losing my
mind


Verse 3
See I thought of
death in a sense of
innocence and since
there was a form of
millitance
That’s my frame of
mind and I been in it
since my birth
At funerals I would
pretend that it hurts
So I figured it’s
worth living at first
But I’m a quitter so
the minute it hurts
I’m a sit in that
hearse to be dipped
in the dirt
Finished with all the
sinners in thoughts
And while the
minister talks I rock
the casket
Standing up
You and the voices
you made me hear
Absolute silence
I made my point;
hearing voices
caused my nuts to
curl
You know it’s bad
when you can’t trust
your girl
Life’s a bitch
Think it’s time we
had a fucking
divorce
I don’t love her no
more

Hook
It’s the voices
All I hear in my head
are these voices
Can’t run can’t hide
Some deem in my
mind it’s the voices
I can’t avoid it
It’s the voices
Some deem in my
mind it’s the voices
Can’t run can’t hide

All I hear in my head
are these voices
I think I’m losing my

Verse 1

If I had a dollar
every time I heard
"This nigga rap?

got on? This shit is
wack"
I swear by now I'd

Could spend it on
crap and then get it
back in 10 minutes
flat
This is a fact
And spit 'till I black
Ball up a fist just to
crack an
instrumental
No fixing it back
I guess a nigga's
style ain't a witness
to that
Favorite color is
pink
But I can promise
you hot hip-hop I'm
not gonna stop
In cyphers
I don't even look the
part
Cause as soon as I
deployed my rhyme
book
Niggas was thinking
it was the boy who
cried wolf
And they got eaten
I used to want to flip
They want to jump
me
Two Spanish pricks
couldn't stand the
kid
Gave me two black
eyes looking like I
wore stunner
shades
Ain't get mad
Slip my nigga 50
cash to whoop his

Looked at him on

Verse 2


My wife been a
pestilence ever
since I cheated with
the next chick
She feels
disrespected. In
essence
But shit
Cause this is ruining
what we got
She loves me
Nah
Literally
I ain't gonna lie
Touched a spot
But it's over
Now my girl treating
me like a convict
So what I'm honest
Same nigga
undercover wifing
hoes and still piping
hoes
But I know when I
get home I gotta
deal with the psycho
Babe I'm not
cheating
She ain't hearing it
End of story
Now I gotta deal
with this shit for 5
days (and hey yo..)
I guess it's her way
or the highway
Now I'm a liar
I know about
Makeda, but who
the fuck is Nya!?
She's still a rider
In her eyes no
matter how hard
I try
Lies are lies but
God damn
I'm being honest
with you
It's cause...

'cause you're so
mad and IDGAF
I just wanna have

Im switching styles
up with the season
Need no reason to
Too many times

dirty

I'm not worthy of

You've gotta keep a
very calm

Made it from the

I'm gonna hit it out

I'm gonna go higher

Still the same me

I must forgive myself

We on an ultralight

Refrain The-Dream
I'm tryna keep my
faith
But I'm looking for
more
Somewhere I can
feel safe
And end my holy
war
I'm tryna keep my
faith

Verse 2 Kelly Price
& Choir
So why send
oppression
Why
You persecute the
weak
Because it makes
You feel so strong
(Safe)
Don't have much
strength to fight
So I look to the light
(War)
To make these
wrongs turn right
Head up high
Hey
And I know that
You'll take good
care of Your child
Oh
Cause I


Bridge Chance The
Rapper
When they come for
You
I will field their
questions
No one can judge
They don't
They don't know

Verse 3 Chance The
Rapper
Foot on the Devil's
neck 'til it drifted
Pangaea
I'm moving all my
family from
Chatham to Zambia
Treat the demons
just like Pam
I mean
I been this way
since Arthur was
anteater
Now they wanna hit
me with the woo
wap
Tryna snap photos
of familia
My daughter look
just like Sia
You can feel the
lyrics
Tubman of the
underground
I made “Sunday
Candy
I met Kanye West
He said
I hear you gotta sell
it to snatch the
Grammy
Let's make it so free
and the bars so hard
That there ain't one
gosh darn part you
can't tweet
This is my part
This is my part
This little light of
mine
Glory be to God
I'ma make sure that
they go where they
can't go
If they don't wanna
ride
Know what God said
when He made the
first rainbow
Just throw this at the
end if I'm too late for
the intro
Ugh
You know that a
nigga was lost
I laugh in my head
Cause I bet that my
ex looking back like
a pillar of salt
Ugh
You cannot mess
with the light
Look at lil' Chano
from 79th

Outro Kirk Franklin
& Choir
Father
This prayer's for
everybody that feel
that they're too
messed up
For everyone that
feels they've said
"I'm sorry" too many
times
You can never go
too far when you
can't come back
home again
That's why I need...
Faith
